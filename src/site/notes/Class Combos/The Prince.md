## [  Role of the Destroyer - The Prince]

Those born with the **Role of the Prince** are trapped in an internal struggle. They consider themselves capable, intelligent, reliable, and they likely are. However, their strong personalities and sets of values tend to make them impose themselves upon others. As figures or authority, or merely taking charge of the situation, a Prince’s biggest flaw is their ego. Thinking they can do it better or that they know better can be quite harmful and detrimental to their relationships with others, and with themselves. From holding themselves to too high standards, to pushing others too hard thinking they’re merely helping them out, Princes must find the internal balance between egotism and self-deprecation, but if they manage to strike the right spot, they can become just as capable as they let on, while showing care, appreciation and devotion like no other. At their best, they’re diligent, skilled and hard to break. At their worst, they can be toxic, rude and arrogant.  
  
Princes may find a relation between their struggle with their ego and their **Aspect**, making it yet another facet they need to come to terms with. Restricting themselves too much, and they will become stressed, unhappy, and destroy themselves. Too permissive and lenient with their more toxic behaviors, and they will become domineering, overwhelming, and destroy those they care about. For better or worse, Princes are a powerful destructive force, and must be careful how they handle themselves. Once everything clicks into place and they find their balance, however, they can become an unstoppable force to fight for their cause, an overwhelming power directed only towards that which they do intend to harm.  
  
Being one of the Destroyer Classes, Princes are the Active counterpart to [[Class Combos/The Bard\|The Bard]], and similar to them, their strengths lie in **Destroying** things. Reducing, Deleting, Erasing their Aspect or through the use of their Aspect, they tend to be powerful combatants capable of dealing devastating blows upon their enemies. They find it most comfortable and easy to exploit their Aspect in order to destroy the obstacles right in front of them, blunt, able to have an immense direct impact in a strife. Beware of getting on the wrong side of a Prince, for few obstacles remain untouched in their path
