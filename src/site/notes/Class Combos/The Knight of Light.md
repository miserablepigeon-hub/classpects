Knights are the active half of the Exploitation class, with their counterpart being the passive Pages. They turn their aspect into a weapon or tool in order to accomplish their goals. Knights tend to have low self-esteem, and all Knights have a false personality that they present to the world. Though they have tremendous attack power, any session with a Knight in it is tragically lacking in that Knight's element.

Light is the aspect of information, relevance, clarity, and luck. It's counterpart is Void. Light players tend to be clever and goal-oriented, often with a love of attention (or being in the spot-light. Heheheheh).

A Knight of Light would have the ability to weaponize luck and information for their own benefit and the benefit of their teammates, be it through afflicting enemies with ill fortune, or using knowledge of their weaknesses against them. This skill makes the Knight of Light a very powerful ally. Unfortunately, the Knight's teammates will suffer from ill fortune and ignorance due to the unspoken payment for the Knight's power.

The role of a Knight of Light in a typical session is an active one. Taking out imps, helping the Space player to breed the Genesis Frog, and fighting the Derse royalty.

Prior to God-tiering, a Knight of Light might be a bookish, factual sort of person (though whether this is their true self or their persona, no one can say) who is highly skilled in their chosen activities or hobbies. Should no one else object or be nominated, it would not be unlikely for a Knight to be made a de facto leader of their group of friends, though such a role would be unlikely to be maintained after the game started. In-game, they would be more likely to receive orders than to issue them, because of their status as an active class with powerful fighting skills.

A Knight of Light is one of the few classes for whom Ascension would be easy. Being a front-line fighter means that the Knight would definitely require the power boost, their aspect would grant them a knowledge of the specifics beforehand, and with their amazing luck they might even be killed painlessly the moment they arrive on their quest bed!

Post God-tiering, a Knight of Light would be an incredibly strong fighter, even more than they already were. Their luck might keep them from being killed at all, so they'd never have to worry about facing the clock of Heroism v. Justice, and they could likely kill hundreds of imps with a single lucky blow.

The inversion of a Knight of Light is a Rogue of Void: one who passively redistributes mystery, secrets, nothingness, and depth.

The potential land of a Knight of Light might be LOCAS, or the Land of Cards and Strife. The masked consorts of this casino-like planet are constantly dealing and playing cards for a game with thousands of rules. As no one can remember all of the rules, the consorts will constantly start fights. But, should a fight break out, the dealer vacates the table and that hand is forfeit. The Knight of Light must use their knowledge of the game paired with their luck to avoid fights and win 3 hands.

Knights tend to use what they perceive as classic or cliched weapons for their strife deck, while Light players tend to use dice or cards. Sicklekind, swordkind, 1/2swordkind, bowkind, lancekind, spearkind, tarotkind, dicekind, or fortunecookiekind may work, though it would probably suit this class more if they alchemized something like a Dice Sword or a Tarot Spear.

Their greatest strength is their marvelous luck and fighting ability, but their greatest weakness is their inability to accept themselves.
(Their second greatest weakness would be an inability to deal with their teammates's taunts about needing a Night-Light.)

Their special power would be super accuracy. Once something's in the sights of a Knight of Light, it's not leaving unscathed.
