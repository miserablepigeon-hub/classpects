Rogues are the passive half of the Allocation classes, with their counterparts being the more active Thieves. They are generally easygoing, friendly, well-liked, and well-known for their relationships - failed or otherwise. Rogues possess the ability to steal their aspect, but rather than keeping it for themselves they redistribute it to where it is either most needed or most lacking. They have been called the Robin Hood of classes.

Light is the aspect of information, relevance, clarity, and luck. Its counterpart is Void. Light players tend to be clever and goal-oriented, often with a love of attention (or being in the spot-light. Heheheheh. That joke never gets old).

The Rogue of Light would have the ability to redistribute information, luck, and relevance to where it was most needed. They would be the friend to mercifully end a bad luck streak, fill in somebody who’d been left in the dark, and bring somebody hiding in the shadows out into the spotlight. What a great friend, really.

The role of a Rogue of Light in a session is a passive one, and one mostly focused on group cohesion. They would be a reasonably skilled fighter, but their talents would be put to better use maintaining the atmosphere of the group and keeping everybody from being too miserable or too plain stupid. Their tendency to lean more toward objective fact and practicality might make them a bit less suited to this group therapist role than, say, a Sylph or a Blood player (or a Sylph of Blood. Can you imagine??), but the Rogue of Light’s occasional bluntness really just adds to their charm.

Prior to ascension, the Rogue of Light would be an intelligent person who somehow managed to toe the fine-line where being a know-it-all stops without actually crossing over into pretentiousness. It’s true that they’re usually right and they usually know it - but they’re so set on helping everybody else out with that information that it’s hard to feel bad in their presence. 

Ascension would be a bit tricky for this title. They would do it for the good of the team or if they felt they had no choice, but they probably wouldn’t jump on the opportunity if they didn’t really have to. They wouldn’t have too much of a problem learning about the details or finding their quest bed, and they’d be quick to spread the info around, so that’s good. 

Post God-tiering, the Rogue of Light would be a force to be reckoned with. Aside from the newfound ability to just straight up blind their enemies (redistributing light, anybody?) they would be able to redistribute luck from their enemies to their allies and, frankly, the Dersite Royalty wouldn’t stand much of a chance.

Their inversion is a Knight of Void, one who actively exploits mystery, secrets, nothingness, and depth.

The potential land of a Rogue of Light might be LoBAM, or the Land of Beams and Mirrors. This desert planet is speckled with skyscraper-sized pillars - some are topped by massive beams of light pouring outward over the sand, but a few are topped by gigantic mirrors that can redirect the beams. One pillar looks as if it is pouring light out, but if you look at the shadows you can see that it’s actually taking light in. If the Rogue of Light uses the mirrors to redirect all of the light toward this pillar, it will sink into the ground, revealing the path to their Denizen.

For a strife specibus, Rogues often go for a lance or other polearm, but Light players tend to use objects of personal significance, even if said weapons aren’t necessarily practical in combat. So, if you’ve got an antique spear lying around, go for it.

Their greatest strength is their love of information and their willingness to share it, but their greatest weakness would be a lack of regard for the non-objective parts of friendly interactions

The special ability of a Rogue of Light would be mass communication. If players and allies are scattered all over the medium and need information on a new development (and are not carrying at least 5 computers on their person at all times, like sensible people) then the Rogue of Light could spread new info, battle plans, gossip, or just shitty puns to everybody despite the distance. A great skill to have in a plot-heavy game like Sburb!
