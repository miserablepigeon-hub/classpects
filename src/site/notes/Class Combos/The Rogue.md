## [Role of the Taker - The Rogue]

Those born with the **Role of the Rogue** are naturally rebellious. They don’t take kindly to the shackles their society puts on them, and would rather do things their way than be bound to an order they don’t agree with, or simply not care much about, whether it be through direct action against the system, or abstracting themselves in their own worlds and interests. As such, Rogues tend to isolate themselves as a way to deal with stressful situations or distance themselves from others. This doesn’t mean they are solitary by nature, however, while selective about those they interact and relate to, they are passionate, open and friendly with those they love, creating strong romantic and platonic bonds that are hard to break. Rogues live for the well being of their small social circle, and aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty if they manage to aid them. At their best, they are generous, receptive and hold strong ideals and convictions. At their worst, they can be impulsive and apathetic.  
  
Rogues may use their **Aspect** as ways to isolate themselves from their societies and their circles, which can be toxic to them in excess. However, casting it away is not the solution, as a more moderate interest and a good understanding of it can turn into a more healthy relationship with their Aspect. Where Rogues shine, however, is not in their direct interaction with their Aspect, but sharing it among their peers. They are team players ready to help those they care about, but if their close bonds start turning into obsession, they can end up damaging themselves and those around them. Moderation and Balance are key for a Rogue, and those who manage to get it right can strengthen their group and support them through whatever they may have to face.  
  
Being one of the Taker Classes, Rogues are the Passive counterpart to [[Class Combos/The Thief\|The Thief]], and similar to them, their strengths lie in **Stealing**. Robbing their Aspect from a source or Taking it away entirely, and Distributing their spoils somewhere else, Rogues are adept at taking from their target, only to spread it among their companions. And while they generally allow their loot to be shared among those who need it, it doesn’t mean they can’t use the Aspect they took as a tool to fend off their foes if pressed. Never lower your guard when facing a Rogue, or they may just steal victory from right under your nose, when you least expect it.
