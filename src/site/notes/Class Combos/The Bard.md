## [Role of the Destroyer - The Bard]

Those born with the **Role of the Bard** faithfully follow their cause. They have something they think is righteous and good, and are devoted to it and those important enough to them. Bards don’t take kindly to mockery or skepticism towards their cause, however, as they see the good and positive in it, so those opposed to it can only be considered as villains. If their faith is broken, they will become disillusioned with that which they so intensely identified with, and may need long periods of time and introspection to find themselves again, to find a new goal. This strong attachment may also apply to friends and people they look up to, but this strong aversion to judgement and change in their point of view can make them rather volatile. At their best, they are willing, helpful and friendly. At their worst, they can be inflexible and antagonistic.  
  
Bards will often find their **Aspect** in the cause they follow, and identify strongly with what it conveys, which only makes it harder for them to see beyond and consider other options. They will share their point of view with others in an attempt to make them see the same way they do. Because of this, the effectiveness of a Bard in a group is wholly determined by who their companions are, and the cause they are fighting for. They may as easily lay back and let others take care of things while they focus on what they deem truly important, as they may take direct action to defend their point of view and crush their foes. They are whimsical and hard to predict in combat, but sometimes the difference between victory and defeat may just be the group’s Bard deciding to take action.  
  
Being one of the Destroyer Classes, Bards are the Passive counterpart to [[Class Combos/The Prince\|The Prince]], and similar to them, their strengths lie in **Destroying** things. Reducing, Erasing, Eliminating, if it needs to be toned down or removed, a Bard is the appropriate choice to do so. They’re proficient at hampering the ability of their foes to properly fight back, and supporting those they are fighting alongside with against anything, but a Bard may also channel their Aspect for destructive purposes, or directly destroy it. Volatile as they are, sometimes all a team needs to do to win, is a little bit of trust placed on the Wildcard
