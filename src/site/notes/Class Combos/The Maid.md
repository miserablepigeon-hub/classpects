## [Role of the Creator - The Maid]

Those born with the **Role of the Maid** tend to differ from their peers. Generally alienated from the norm in some way or other, they struggle with what fate has in store for them, and fight to liberate themselves in order to be happy. The world seems to want them to give more than they are willing to with little payback, wearing them out, and only by gaining control of their situation and asserting what they want can they fully express themselves. While held back, Maids tend to bottle up their true desires and emotions, they may become complacent, even resigned about their situation, but once things reach a breaking point, or hopefully, once given a chance to break free, they will let their true demeanor out and seek what they think is best for themselves. They can show a passionate love for the things they deem important, while holding a similarly passionate contempt and dislike for the things that wronged them and those they care about. At their best, they are capable, understanding, encouraging and content. At their worst, they can be irascible, remorseful and become alienated from the rest of their circle.  
  
Maids share a very close relationship with their **Aspect**, which can be often times as beneficial as it can be damaging. The struggle they need to face and overcome is often related to their Aspect, but that doesn’t mean they can only become happy if they reject it entirely. In fact, completely disregarding their Aspect can be just as toxic for them as being shackled by it. Freeing themselves to adopt facets selectively, or making what forcefully bound them theirs instead, turning the tables on their situation, but never casting their Aspect completely away, a fully realized Maid needs to know how to strike a balance. Once this balance is found, they can become an extremely effective and confident power to be relied on. Ignoring or dismissing a Maid’s struggle and desires, however, can easily turn them against you, and they won’t be afraid to hold it against you if things get bad enough.  
  
Being one of the Creator Classes, Maids are the Active counterpart to [[Class Combos/The Sylph\|The Sylph]], and similar to them, their strengths lie in **Making** things. The power of Creation, Improvement, Growth, flows through them, allowing them to amplify their impact in combat or empower themselves with their Aspect. Not only that, but, while more prone to taking direct action, Maids can just as easily use their powers to similarly Aid and Enable those they’re fighting alongside with, allowing them to be reliable in any situation. They fight for what they want, and they are going to take it
