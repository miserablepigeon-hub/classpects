Seers are the passive half of the Understanding class, with their counterpart being Mages. Seers tend to be a bit self-righteous, with a strong sense of fairness and justice. They fully understand their aspect, and share that knowledge with their teammates in order to give the group an advantage. They are among the most passive and strategic of classes.

Heart is the aspect of Love, Passion, Individuality, and Soul. Its counterpart is Mind. Heart players may be passionate and illogical, embracing an idea with little to no logical evidence. They are most likely cheerful and very friendly. Unfortunately, Heart players are doomed to have at least one completely disastrous relationship (or an unrequited love), and tend to have splintered personalities that show themselves through roleplay, mood swings, or copies of themselves.

The Seer of Heart would have the ability to understand passion, romance, and individuality, as well as the ability to share that knowledge with teammates. They would make a wonderful ally, and would be well suited to a strategist's position within the group. Their thorough understanding of their allies' personalities, mannerisms, and emotions may be unnerving to some, but the Seer of Heart would not use their abilities to harm anyone (except imps, of course), and would be a true and loyal friend.

The role of a Seer of Heart in a typical Sburb session is passive, but still very busy: as the strategists who direct the other players toward the most emotionally healthy outcome, they must map out battle tactics, issue orders, and constantly be on the lookout for any new variables that may throw a wrench in their plans, all while staying out of trouble themselves. While they may be powerful strategists they are pretty crummy fighters, and are better left leaving the dirty work to the other players. If they can find the time, the Seer of Heart may have some luck playing matchmaker for their teammates - and nobody's better suited to it than them.

Prior to God-tiering, the Seer of Heart would be a cheerful person, and a truly amazing friend. They would have many associates, but only a few people would truly understand quite how good of a friend they have: no birthday would go forgotten, and no teary eye would be unmatched by a hug. Expect shipping walls to be everywhere - unless they choose to keep such walls mental, instead of physical. In spite of their phenomenal skill with hooking up their pals romantically, they themselves would not have a very good romantic life - even if they did study the fundamentals of human attraction extensively. They would likely be extremely intelligent, though perhaps a bit more people-smart than book-smart. 

Ascension is a difficult affair, and many players choose not to go through with it. A Seer of Heart may be one of those players, as they aren't a front-line fighter and thus aren't in an abundance of danger with a high mortality rate. They may well choose to conquer their fear though, and their friends would be a large factor in their ultimate decision. 

Post God-tiering, the Seer of Heart would be a formidable tactician. Their knowledge of all of their teammates' personalities, abilities, and emotional states means that they would know exactly whom to send where to do what, with a high degree of success. If anyone was faking even the slightest part of their personality, the Seer of Heart would know, making it impossible to infiltrate their team.

The inversion of a Seer of Heart is a Witch of Mind; one who actively manipulates choices, thought, and intelligence.

The potential land of a Seer of Heart might be LOCAF, or the Land of Conscience and Frenzy. The large dragonfly consorts of this fountain spotted land have been majorly screwed over by the local denizen. The souls and emotions of each and every consort has been totally scrambled, leaving them all panicking. It's up to the Seer of Heart to use their understanding of individuality to unscramble everything and remind everyone of who they truly are. 

Seers often use thin, pointed weapons for their strife specibus, while heart players prefer handheld slicing weapons. Bladekind, knifekind, clawkind, canekind, and needlekind are all options, but something like foilkind would be truly ideal.

The greatest strength of a Seer of Heart is their passionate intellect paired with their strategic ability, but their greatest weakness would come from trying to act as a fighter rather than a planner, or from getting too worked up about their failed romance(s).

The special ability of a Seer of Heart would be Ultimate Matchmaking! By seeing everyone's true selves and by accessing their thorough understanding of their aspect, the Seer of Heart would know exactly who would benefit most from which relationships. Cupid better work on his resume, 'cause there's a new love god on the scene!
