## [Role of the Innovator - The Witch]

Those born with the **Role of the Witch** are ambitious and practical. They desire bringing a change they perceive as positive to the world around them, and may just as well change themselves to suit a more idealised self. Passionate about that which they love, they can be heavily influenced by their interests and by their surroundings, and show the same amount of passion about that which they hate. Witches dislike wasting time, and would rather use their resources and energy in furthering their goals, which makes them reliable when it comes to find a practical solution. However, this trait is a double edged sword, as they may quickly dismiss that which they can’t grasp as easily, or which requires an inordinate amount of time and effort from them, preferring to focus on their own interests and making them avoid what isn’t worth their time. First impressions are important for them, and they can be quite stubborn about what they do and do not enjoy. At their best, they’re positive, hard working dreamers. At their worst, they can be neglectful, resentful and closed-minded.  
  
Witches’ lives are permeated by the presence of their **Aspect**, partially in their interests and that which they want to bring change to, and also as an element of their environment bringing change to them, and which they may overcome. They are not pushovers, but bad influences in their surroundings can easily wear a Witch out, and eventually, consume their passion and will. As such, in order to be happy, they must cast away these oppressive forces that try to impose on themselves, assert their agency and ideals. For, once a Witch casts aside that which has been holding them back, their sights will quickly set on their goal, efficiently, and without a rest.  
  
Being one of the Innovator Classes, Witches are the Active counterpart to [[Class Combos/The Heir\|The Heir]], and similar to them, their strengths lie in **Changing** things. Transforming, Modifying and Manipulating their Aspect, themselves, others, and their surroundings as they see fit, a Witch’s powers’ versatility knows no bounds. Much like how they change everything through the use of their Aspect, even the tides of battle quickly shift under the heel of a Witch. Efficient in combat as they are with everything else, it’s better to stay out their way, lest they cast a spell on you
