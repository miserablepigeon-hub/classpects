## [Role of the Visionary - The Seer]


Those born with the **Role of the Seer** are seekers of knowledge. They have an innate awareness of their surroundings and a knack for learning, recalling and analysing their interests, no matter how difficult or dense they may be. As such, a Seer’s inner world may be as confusing and complicated as their interests, making it sometimes hard to get to know them properly. On top of that, they tend to struggle with grey areas, dividing in their mind what’s right and wrong. This black and white point of view can be biased, muddling in turn the insight a Seer may be able to offer otherwise. They can become easily frustrated when presented with choices or situations that don’t fit their divide of the world, and need to eventually learn not everything in the world is as clear as it seems to them. When they think something is right, they will try hard to share it with others, and won’t easily back down on their word. At their best they are capable, intelligent and always eager to offer advice to others. At their worst, they can be pedantic and zealous about their opinions and thoughts.  
  
Seers don’t need to be specially comfortable with their **Aspect**, rather, their Aspect determines what kind of insight and information comes more naturally to them, or what they have an easier time understanding. As such, intrusive thoughts are their enemy, and paranoia can easily take hold of them if they’re not careful, making them obsess playing scenarios in their minds over and over. If something manages to muddle their vision and presents what they thought to be true as wrong, a Seer’s sense of self can easily be shattered, doubts about themselves and regrets about the outcomes they should have been able to predict will plague their mind, and the healing process won’t be an easy journey. Seers tend to be well meaning, however, and even when things aren’t going too well for them, they’re open to talk and listen to those they care about, to offer whatever little bit of help they may be able to.  
  
Being one of the Visionary Classes, Seers are the Passive counterpart to [[Class Combos/The Mage\|The Mage]], and similar to them, their strengths lie in **Knowing** things. Understanding, Learning, and Guiding others through their knack for the subject in general, they can be powerful aids when it comes to planning and strategy. This doesn’t mean they’re completely meant for utility, however, as with their insight and awareness, a Seer can use that which they have seen to bend causality to their whims. Once they know the outcome, they can focus on reaching it or preventing it. Precision, Subtlety, Cunning, a Seer adept in the arts of combat may become completely untouchable, and perform feats others would have deemed completely impossible. For those they care about, they will bend the future if they need to
