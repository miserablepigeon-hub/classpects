Pages are the passive half of the Exploitation class, with their counterparts being the more active Knights. Pages tend to be extremely weak throughout the majority of the game, but upon reaching godhood and a state of emotional maturity their power becomes essentially unmatchable by any class (though Lords may possibly be more powerful, it would certainly be a close fight). Pages tend to be easily led around by others and rarely make decisions entirely of their own accord. Pages should avoid Sylphs at all costs, as the Sylph’s tendency to mother and care for others will lead them to try to ‘fix’ the Page - something that throws off the Page’s naturally slow growth and is potentially quite harmful.

Rage is the aspect of negative emotions, unpredictability, limited choices, and conviction. Its counterpart is Hope. Rage has associations with religion, which is odd in that the aspect of faith, Hope, is its opposite. In spite of its reputation as ‘bad’ or ‘evil’, Rage is just as necessary as any other aspect and just as likely to be good.

The Page of Rage would have the ability to passively exploit rage in the form of negative emotion and limited choices. A wild temper tantrum - rather than harming friendships - would actually help them to gather info or impress people. Their allies would benefit from the positive effects of Rage as well, making their session a fortunate place wherein to get pissed off.

The role of a Page of Rage in a typical Sburb session would be a passive one: allowing anger to work as their weapon, arming allies with rage, and working to become as strong as possible.

Prior to God-tiering, the Page of Rage might be a bit spoiled - and if they don't get their way then getting angry or crying about it may often yield bounteous results. Some of the Page's friends might be shallow and faking friendships for personal gain rather than emotional intimacy, and the Page's low-key starting abilities and temper may exacerbate this by allowing the manipulators to undermine the Page's self-worth and group standing. On the other hand, the Page's true friends will get to see friendly, fun-loving, somewhat sporadic person the Page of Rage truly is.

Ascension is unlikely for a Page of Rage, but if they get worked enough about it then the game itself will bend to their wishes and deliver them to a quest bed.

Post God-tiering, the Page of Rage would be among the most potent attack units available - assuming that they are fully realized and capable of unleashing their full abilities. Armed with the pure destructive forces of Rage, the Page of Rage would be an unstoppable being of undying pissy-ness. The fury of every long-winded rant Karkat ever spoke - if condensed - might equal half of a molecule of the pure tsunami of irritability the Page of Rage could unleash. May Hussie have mercy on our souls.

The inversion of a Page of Rage is a Thief of Hope; one who actively steals positive emotion, harmony, and faith.

The potential land of a Page of Rage might be LOIAS, or the Land of Ire and Storms. The seagull consorts of this planet are positively sick of the eternal bad weather. They have a great many ideas about how to avoid or stop it: underground tunnels, weather alteration devices, bigger umbrellas... unfortunately, none of them will acknowledge any idea but their own so nothing gets done. The Page of Rage must embrace their inner jerk and use some tough love to convince the seagulls to band together under a single concept. Once the idea is put into full effect, the Page can investigate their land and try to find their denizen.

Pages use conventional weapons that are often linked to their ideal career path. Rage players can be pretty versatile, but seem to favor religious paraphernalia. Perhaps the Page of Rage hopes to become a religious leader?

Their greatest weakness is their unbearably slow growth rates, but their greatest strength is their ultimate power level.

The special ability of a Page of Rage would be the Irritability Sphere! By spreading their influence out around them in all directions, the Page of Rage could both weaponize their anger and use it as a shield. In this state they would be nigh unstoppable, and really, really grumpy.
