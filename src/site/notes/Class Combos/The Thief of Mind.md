Thieves are the active half of the allocation classes, with its counterpart being the Rogue. They move their aspect from one location to another, often hoarding it for themselves. Thieves tend to be dramatic and self-righteous, so it is often difficult for them to keep friends, in spite of their charisma.

Mind is the aspect of intelligence, awareness, and decision-making. It's counterpart is Heart. Mind players tend to be subtle, cunning, and manipulative, though it should be said that that is not necessarily a bad thing.
A Thief of Mind would possess the ability to steal Mind in the form of intelligence, thought, or decisions from opponents or teammates and hoard it for themselves. A Thief of Mind would be a powerful ally - but due to their often self-serving nature they might not stay that way, and might instead become a dangerous enemy.
The role of a Thief of Mind in a typical session would be an active one; taking out imps, stealing info for battle plans, and fighting the Derse royalty. 

Prior to God-tiering, a Thief of Mind would be an extremely bewildering person to be around. Robbing others of logical reasoning and stealing their secrets out from under them, all while subtly pushing others to act in a way that benefits their ultimate plan - and maybe even making them think it was their idea to begin with!

Actual ascension might be difficult (it usually is) but a Thief of Mind definitely wouldn't be one to back down from fear. Knowing that it would make them stronger, they almost certainly would try to reach Godhood - be it out of pride, or just logical decision making.

Post God-tiering, they would probably become a bit less enigmatic with their manipulation habits. Possessing the ability to steal someone's mind by merely thinking about it means they would probably rely less on conventional manipulation tactics.

The inversion of a Thief of Mind is a Page of Heart; one who passively exploits individuality, soul, and emotion.

The potential land of a Thief of Mind might be LOLAL, or the Land of Logic and Labyrinths. The giant maze-like surface of the planet seems impossible to figure out at first, but it's actually fairly straightforward to navigate once you get the hang of it. However, due to the denizen's meddling, the overly-suspicious consorts constantly overthink things, and disbelieve anyone who tries to give them directions. As such, they are always getting themselves lost. The Thief must learn to steal away their poor decision-making so they can get to their destinations - and eventually steal the knowledge of the denizen's location.

Upon reaching God-tier, the Thief of Mind might not even need a strife-specibus because they could just prevent opponents from fighting in the first place. For those who still need one, long stabbing weapons seem to work well for Thieves and Mind players alike, so something like swordkind, canekind, lancekind, spearkind, glaivekind, or 2x3dentkind would probably be best.

Their greatest strength would be their manipulation and cunning, but their greatest weakness would be their own hubris and poor cooperation skills.

Their unique power would be mind-reading. Stealing the thoughts right out of peoples' heads is a very useful power to have, but doing so without permission might make allies distrust them.
