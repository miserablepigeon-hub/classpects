Rogues are the passive half of the Allocation classes, with their counterparts being the more active Thieves. They are generally easygoing, friendly, well-liked, and well-known for their relationships - failed or otherwise. Rogues possess the ability to steal their aspect, but rather than keeping it for themselves they redistribute it to where it is either most needed or most lacking. They have been called the Robin Hood of classes.

Breath is the aspect of wind, freedom, change, and confidence. It’s counterpart is Blood. Breath players tend to be extremely difficult to control or manipulate, even if it’s for their own good.

The Rogue of Breath would have the ability to redistribute freedom and confidence. This not only is tremendously useful for allies, but could also be helpful to those who appear to be opponents. Stealing the confidence and freedom of the Derse royalty and redistributing it to the Dersite and Prospitian soldiers on the battlefield could result in the Rogue of Breath leading an entire army against the Black King and Queen.

The role of a Rogue of Breath in a typical Sburb session is a passive one: finding teammates lacking in freedom and redirecting some Breath-ing room their way. (Heheheh. See what I did there? Heheheh. Okay, sorry.) They must also remove the freedom and capacity for change from opponents. 

Prior to God-tiering, the Rogue of Breath would probably be mellow, well-liked, cheerful, and friendly - though probably unreliable and a bit of a space-case. While it's unlikely that anyone they know truly dislikes them, they may have a touchy history with an ex-datemate or have an unrequited crush on a team member. The Rogue of Breath is the kind of person a teammate would go to if they're stuck in a rut or trapped somewhere, be it physically or emotionally. Although Rogues are team players, their Breath aspect makes them a bit of a lone wolf, so it's unlikely that anyone fully understands them; something the Rogue might resent.

Ascension is unlikely for a Rogue of Breath, but Breath players are unpredictable and may sprint to their Quest Bed just as easily as sprinting away from it. The Rogue of Breath would probably worry a fair a bit about the whole 'dying' part of ascension, but their easy acceptance of change would make it easy for them to recover from any trauma should they choose to go through with it.

Post God-tiering, the Rogue of Breath would be a powerful ally with a small to nonexistent chance of turning on their team. They would be the glue holding everyone together and keeping them confident in their chances of winning. While their fighting abilities are nothing to write home about, their skills can easily turn the tide of war and prevent unnecessary bloodshed.

The inversion of a Rogue of Breath is a Knight of Blood; one who actively exploits or weaponizes unity, responsibility, and familial bonds.

The potential land of a Rogue of Breath might be LOFAB, or the Land of Fans and Biplanes. Massive, building-sized fans dot the surface of this grassy planet, and biplanes fly in the distant sky, piloted by the purple iguana consorts. Unfortunately, the positions of the fans make it impossible for the planes to land, and they are trapped up in the sky. The Rogue must steal the Breath in the form of wind from the fans and deliver it to the pilots as freedom. When the planes land, they can borrow one of the planes (not that the pilots would want it back) and follow the new path of the fans to the denizen's lair.

Rogues prefer to use their hands or glove based weapons for their strife-specibus, but Breath players are free spirits that will equip anything that might suit their fancy. Fistkind, clawkind, brassknucklekind, boxingglovekind, fankind, or umbrellakind could all work.

Their greatest strength is their mellow, cheerful nature, but their greatest weakness is being over flighty or passive.

The special ability of a Rogue of Breath is prison breaks! Not only could they remove the intended prisoner from their cell, but they could also steal the freedom of their guard and put them in there instead! Nobody's gonna get held captive with a Rogue of Breath on the loose!
