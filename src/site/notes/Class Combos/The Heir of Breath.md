Heirs are the passive half of the Manipulation classes, with their counterpart being Witches. They passively change, move around, or alter their aspect, and over time begin to completely embody it. Heirs tend to have very strong friendships, but don't always act when they should.
Breath is the aspect of wind, freedom, change, and confidence. It's counterpart is Blood. Breath players tend to be extremely difficult to control or manipulate, even if it's for their own good.

The Heir of Breath would possess the ability to subconsciously control Breath in the form of freedom, change, or literal wind. As their abilities increased or in moments of high stress, an Heir of Breath may literally become their element, though such a power is most likely outside of their control.

The role of an Heir of Breath in a typical Sburb session is a passive one: clear out the obstacles holding back their teammates (thus increasing their freedom) and prevent stagnation or stalemates where possible.

Prior to God-tiering, an Heir of Breath would probably have strong friendships, but be misunderstood or underestimated. Not that the Heir would mind - they'd likely have their head too high up in the clouds to notice. Their interests might seem bizarre or illogical, but the Heir of Breath could likely talk about them for hours on end, no matter how the listener might protest.

Ascension won't be an especially troubling event for an Heir of Breath, but it is an unlikely one. The Heir of Breath is a very passive player, and it's hard to imagine them rushing to their death to increase their power. Either the situation is dire enough for the Heir to decide on such an extreme action, or the Heir was led to Godhood by outside forces.

The inversion of an Heir of Breath is a Mage of Blood: one who actively spreads knowledge of unity, responsibility, and familial bonds.

The potential land of an Heir of Breath might be LODAW, or the Land of Deserts and Windmills. The birdlike consorts are half-buried in the desert sands, but trying to dig them up only seems to make them more stuck, and the massive gate leading to the denizen is kept decidedly shut. If a strong enough wind can be mustered, the sand imprisoning the consorts will be blown away, and the motionless windmills will spring into life, opening the denizen's gate.

Heirs and Breath players alike are free spirits that choose Strife Specibi to suit their interests or convenience, rather than ease in battle. Something like hammerkind, lancekind, fankind, propellerkind, umbrellakind, or figurinekind may work, though the options are practically limitless for this class.

The greatest strength of an Heir of Breath would be their freedom and confidence, but their greatest weakness would be excessive passivity or a lack of conviction.  Their special power would be turning into wind. Evading the attacks of enemies along with reduced travel costs make this a very useful power indeed.
