Witches are the active half of the Manipulation classes, with their counterparts being the more passive Heirs. Witches are among the most active and powerful of classes, with their abilities bordering on game breaking. They are unique in their roles in that a Witch is supposed to view their session as a whole, and then decide when to break the game's rules to help themselves and their team. Unfortunately - due to their extreme power levels - Witches rarely end up using their abilities. This leads to potential problems with Witches becoming overly passive. When they do use their powers, rest assured it's for something big. Witches are usually friendly but incredibly energetic - or at least they start out that way. Incredible amounts of stress, which is to say 'daily Sburb life', may alter a Witch's mental state - which would spell disaster for their team.

Light is the aspect of information, relevance, clarity, and luck. It’s counterpart is Void. Light players tend to be clever and goal-oriented, often with a love of attention (or being in the spot-light. Heheheheh).

The Witch of Light would have the ability to actively manipulate luck, probability, and relevance. If the players faced a bout of ill fortune, a seemingly unbeatable opponent, or simply lacked the information they needed, a fully-fledged Witch of Light would be able to shift the tides of war in a matter of moments with minimal effort. "What is the likelihood of a well-timed UFO crash landing directly on our opponent?" someone may ask. "Well, it's 100%, now." The Witch of Light may answer. And so it would be. 

The role of a Witch of Light in a typical Sburb session is an extremely active one: slaying imps, altering information, keeping the team's luck high, and taking out the Derse Royalty.

Prior to Ascension, the Witch of Light would be a very cheerful, energetic person. They would likely have one or two people they are extremely close to, and be generally accepted by anyone else they met. Expect them to constantly be on the move - adjusting to new information that they receive, something important that just came up, and unlikely events that just seem to follow them around. 

Ascension, would be surprisingly difficult for a Witch of Light. Though they might find their quest bed with relative ease, and even have the means to embrace death at their disposal, an underdeveloped Witch will be extremely passive and possibly even fail to acknowledge their own importance to the team. In this mindset, they may be unwilling to put their life on the line.

Post God-tiering, the Witch of Light would be a positive whirlwind of adjustments and good fortune. While they may not do a whole lot at any given moment, when they launch into action, everyone in a 200 mile radius knows things are about to go down.

The inversion of a Witch of Light would be a Sylph of Void; one who passively understands mystery, secrets, nothingness, and depth.

The potential land of a Witch of Light might be LOIAR, or the Land of Insight and Radiance. The frilled neck lizard consorts worship the sunlight that reflects over the glass surface of this brilliant planet, but they aren't especially careful about remembering sunglasses. Their vision is beginning to fail them, and they will be completely blinded if the Witch of Light doesn't act soon. They can change the brightness of the reflections, shift the lizards' ideas about how relevant the light is, or just increase all of their luck to the point that they are miraculously free of eye-problems.

Witches can use any number of things for their strife specibus, but strangely they always use a weapon of the same type as another player - they will eventually meet this other player, though they may not be from the same session. Their strife decks are usually equipped with something easily recognizable as a weapon, not to mention something that they use daily. This ties in well with Light players' tendency to use small everyday items for their strife deck.

Their greatest strength is their phenomenal power and ability to break the rules of the game, but their greatest weakness is their potential to become overly passive while not using their power. 

The special ability of a Witch of Light is Probability Manipulation! Odds of winning the lottery? 100%. Odds of getting the coolest looking God Tier pajamas? 100%. Odds of finding an entire living room full of potato chips? 10,000%.
