Lords are the active half of the two Master Classes, and their counterparts are the more passive Muses. Lords possess the combined powers of all of the active basic classes (Knight, Mage, Thief, Witch, Maid, and Prince). They are the most active of all the classes, and little is known about them. They are extremely powerful, and are constantly doing something - they would never let anyone else outdo them for even a moment.

Breath is the aspect of wind, freedom, change, and confidence. It’s counterpart is Blood. Breath players tend to be extremely difficult to control or manipulate, even if it’s for their own good.

The Lord of Breath would have the ability to completely control wind, freedom, change, and confidence. Everybody should try to stay on the Lord of Breath's good side; with even a thought they could imprison opponents and demolish their self-esteem.

No session with a Muse or Lord could be called typical, but the role of a Lord of Breath in an Sburb session is an active one; creating, destroying, and altering freedom and change.

Prior to God-tiering, the Lord of Breath would be a very take-charge kind of person, but when they weren't leading anyone they would be incredibly hard to predict. Their self esteem could make Narcissus turn away in shame, and they would constantly be starting new projects without ever finishing the ones they already have. Heck, they might not even get the thoughts down on paper before they come up with a new idea. Expect them to get bored nigh-instantaneously and to constantly be on the lookout for something new and exciting.

Ascension would be a shockingly easy affair for the Lord of Breath. Their willingness to embrace change, combined with their 'get-things-done' mindset, means that they wouldn't even think twice about facing death to reach Godhood.

Post God-tiering, the Lord of Breath would be an unstoppable force of pure wind and narcissism. They might just end up creating an entire universe full of freedom and self confidence, making imprisonment and low self esteem into incomprehensible ideas.

The inversion of a Lord of Breath is a Muse of Blood; one who passively embodies unity, responsibility, and familial bonds.
There is not enough information about either of the Master Classes to theorize on their potential lands. Just know that their quest would be extreme. 

Breath players are free spirits who choose convenience and sentimentality over practicality when it comes to equipping their strife deck, but Lords are powerful enough to make even a fancy santa into a weapon of mass destruction. Anything could work for this title.

Their greatest strength is their incredible power, but their greatest weakness is their refusal to take a back seat and let others work on things.
The special ability of a Lord of Breath is completely controlling wind, freedom, change, and confidence. Why yes, that is the same as their regular ability. The Lord of Breath is already special.
