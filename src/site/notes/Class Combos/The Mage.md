## [  Role of the Visionary - The Mage]

Those born with the **Role of the Mage** are naturally insightful. Introspection and learning more about themselves is as important to them as learning the ins and outs of what has become important to them. They have an idealized view of how the world around them should work, and will strive to make their Reality pleasant and bearable for themselves, even when it may not be the best path for others. Mistakes can weigh heavy on a Mage’s shoulders, but their biggest enemy is the immutability of a world they don’t deem fair and that has wronged them in the past. Due to this, while eager to share their knowledge and interests with those they trust, they may become reclusive if they fall to the clutches of self-deprecation and lack of agency. At their best, they are deep, optimistic and great teachers to those willing to learn. At their worst, they can be fatalistic and isolate themselves from their peers.  
  
Mages find their **Aspect** coming quite naturally to them, they barely need to try to understand their strengths and weaknesses. As such, they will use the insight they know is there to lead others and change fate in ways that suit them. However, this insight isn’t always appreciated, and as such, a Mage may begin overthinking what should be simple and straightforward, sending them down a swirling spiral they need to escape as soon as possible. Their struggle is that of their desires and wants versus the inevitability of reality around them. Confident and stubborn Mages will push forward with all their might and not let anything stand in their way of what they want, but if they become disillusioned with the way things are, they may fall prey of complacency and acceptance against their better desires. And yet trying to change the unchangeable may come with a heavy price for them. Striking a balance between what they can do and what they want to do is vital for them, lest they push themselves too hard.  
  
Being one of the Visionary Classes, Mages are the Active counterpart to [[Class Combos/The Seer\|The Seer]], and similar to them, their strengths lie in **Knowing** things. Their Insight about their Aspect and Themselves is unmatched, and will Teach and Guide others through that which they find important and relevant to their interests. Foresight, Planning, Mages will not be taken by surprise easily, and will fight back with all they have in order to change that which they don’t agree with. They’re miracle workers that will take hold of their Aspect to both ensure things go smoothly, and to directly engage those who dare oppose them. A Mage’s conviction is nothing to shrug at, and if you stand in their path, they will show you the hard way.
