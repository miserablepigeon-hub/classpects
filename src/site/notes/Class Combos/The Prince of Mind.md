. Princes are the active half of the destruction class, with their counterparts being the more passive Bards. Princes tend to be self-aggrandizing and overestimate their own ability, but in their defense they are usually very skilled at their work. Princes and Bards alike spend a majority of their time inverting their aspect due to their roles as destroyers, but must learn to embrace their aspect even as they destroy it.

Mind is the aspect of intelligence, awareness, and decision-making. Its counterpart is Heart. Mind players tend to be subtle, cunning, and manipulative, though it should be said that that is not necessarily a bad thing.

The Prince of Mind would have the ability to destroy intelligence and choices of allies and enemies alike. If there's a team member who seems to disregard the group in favor of their own goals (lookin' at you, Vriska), the Prince of Mind is the perfect person to combat them. By destroying their choices to act outside of the group's best interest, the Prince of Mind would make a fantastic regulator of teammates contemplating turning against the group. However, should the Prince turn on the group, they would make a fierce opponent and would very difficult to fight.

The role of a Prince of Mind in a typical Sburb session is an active one: fighting imps, destroying poor decisions and enemy intelligence, and fighting the Derse royalty.

Prior to God-tiering, the Prince of Mind might act more like a Heart player than a mind player, due to the frequent inversion of the destroyer classes. They might be cheerful and romantic, to the point where others might be surprised by their role as a destroyer. Unfortunately, they might not be especially clever - or at least not conventionally so. They might often find themselves being forced into things by their situation, or being the last one to find out something important - if they find it out at all. Their friends and family might also suffer from the limitations on their options and intelligence.

Ascension would be greatly appreciated by the Prince of Mind - being a frontline fighter they would need the power boost and lowered mortality rate - but it's unlikely that they would ascend. Being a destroyer of choices and intelligence means they might not even realize the importance of godhood, or they may not be afforded the choice to face death at all.

Post God-tiering, a well-developed Prince of Mind would be a truly phenomenal force of pure mental carnage. Nobody would be able to think straight in the Prince's presence, and enemies might lose their minds entirely. They would be a fearsome foe indeed. 

The inversion of a Prince of Mind is a [[Class Combos/The Sylph of Heart\|The Sylph of Heart]]; one who passively heals individuality, soul, and emotion.

The potential land of a Prince of Mind might be LOSAI, or the Land of Sparks and Inspiration. What was once a planet-wide library has since flooded, allowing the electric eel consorts to make the place their home. The eels are a very intelligent group, often thinking up answers to puzzles and feeling the spark of inspiration - literally. Every time they feel especially clever they electrocute the water around them, damaging bookshelves and sending even more books flying from the shelves to their watery doom. The Prince of Mind must destroy their intelligence to save the books and gain info on their powers and denizen - or they can help destroy the bookshelves and look for the denizen's lair beneath the wreckage.

Princes use powerful weapons that they received as gifts or had handed down to them, so be on the lookout for a legendary rifle or an unbreakable sword. 

Their greatest strength is their incredible attack power, but their greatest weakness would come from refusing to accept their role as a destroyer by over-embracing Heart.

The special ability of a Prince of Mind is Mind-breaking! Encountered a villain truly terrifying in their raw skill and capacity for evil? Met someone who was truly set on doing something that would doom all sentient life in paradox space? Just feeling a bit vindictive? Completely destroy the minds of your opponents, leaving them as empty, drooling husks of the people they once were!
