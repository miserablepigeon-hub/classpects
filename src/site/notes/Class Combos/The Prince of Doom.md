Princes are the active half of the destruction class, with their counterparts being the more passive Bards. Princes tend to be self-aggrandizing and overestimate their own ability, but in their defense they are usually very skilled at their work. Princes and Bards alike spend a majority of their time inverting their aspect due to their roles as destroyers, but must learn to embrace their aspect even as they destroy it.

Doom is the aspect of death, sacrifice, rules, order, and authority. It's counterpart is Life. Doom players tend to lose the most of all the aspects due to the power of their sacrifices, and have a love of order - an interest in computer coding, following the instructions for Lego sets, or paint by color art books would be right up a Doom player's alley. Though Doom seems like a gloomy aspect, it's quite possible to be a peppy, cheerful Doom player.

A Prince of Doom would have the ability to destroy doom in the form of rules and authority, though they would also have the ability to destroy through doom, which might take the form of leading entire ghost armies. Should a Prince of Doom sacrifice themselves for the sake of their teammates, even death itself might not hold them back. Destroying death might mean they can bring themselves back to life - or they might even have more power as a ghost, destroying through death. The Prince of Doom would be a fantastic source of fighting power, and a welcome addition on any team - though like all destruction classes, teammates should keep a watchful eye to make sure they don't turn against the other players.

The role of a Prince of Doom in a typical Sburb session is an active one; taking out imps, destroying rules holding back the team, and fighting the Derse royalty. 

Prior to God-tiering, the Prince of Doom would act much more like a Life player than a Doom player. They might disregard authority, greatly dislike rules, and try to take care of or heal others. Their ability to completely break down rules and regulations would make them a terror in any public school, so they probably wouldn't be the best student - though they may be quite intelligent. The Prince of Doom would probably not be someone to try to make plans with, because assuming that they don't reject the plan outright, they still probably won't be able to follow it precisely.

Ascension is always difficult, but it might be a straightforward affair to the Prince of Doom. Assuming that they were well-developed, their knowledge of sacrifice and death would make it easy for them to die for the sake of more power. If they were under-developed, though (still acting like a complete Life player) they might completely reject the idea of dying at all and adamantly refuse to reach Godhood.

Post God-tiering, the Prince of Doom reach an understanding of their aspect, and of how to work it to their advantage. Their increased power would make them a formidable foe, and their destruction of order would make them difficult to control or manipulate.

The inversion of a Prince of Doom would be a Sylph of Life; one who passively fixes energy, rebellion, and healing.

The potential land of a Prince of Doom might be LOHAH, or the Land of Hemlock and Hawthorn. The oddly coloured, medicinal trees on this forest planet are nothing like the trees on earth, but danger lurks in these woods. Certain trees are completely, horrifyingly poisonous, and they are beginning to take over the forest. The Prince of Doom must destroy the toxic plants to save the healing ones - or they could cultivate them to weaponize their poison. Either way, they need to act fast. The hummingbird consorts are starting to lose the healing trees that they use for homes and food. 

Princes use powerful weapons that they received as gifts or had handed down to them, while Doom players aren't known to use strife specibi at all. Perhaps they use an inherited skill or power?

Their greatest strength would be their powerful attack power and sacrifices, but their greatest weakness would be a refusal to accept their abilities by over-embracing Life.

The special ability of a Prince of Doom would be poltergeist powers! Coming back from the dead as a ghost of sheer destruction would be well suited to the Prince of Doom.
