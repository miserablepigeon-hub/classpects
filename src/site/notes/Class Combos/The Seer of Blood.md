Seers are the passive half of the Understanding class, with their counterpart being Mages. Seers tend to be a bit self-righteous, with a strong sense of fairness and justice. They fully understand their aspect and share that knowledge with their teammates in order to give the group an advantage. They are among the most passive and strategic of classes.

Blood is the aspect of unity, family, bonds, friendship, and responsibility. It’s counterpart is Breath. Blood players tend to be overly serious - often to a laughable point. Blood players may also have unique physical blood - such as a mutation, rare blood type, or disease - or a unique bloodline/ family tree.

The Seer of Blood would have the ability to passively understand emotional bonds, friendship, unity, and responsibility. Their knowledge of their teammates’ senses of responsibility and friendship will allow them to guide their team toward a unified goal. 

The role of a Seer of Void in a typical Sburb session is passive, but still very busy: as the strategists who direct the other players toward the most unified outcome, they must map out battle tactics, issue orders, and constantly be on the lookout for any new variables that may throw a wrench in their plans, all while staying out of trouble themselves. While they may be powerful strategists they are pretty crummy fighters, and are better left leaving the dirty work to the other players. 

Prior to God-tiering, the Seer of Blood would be a conscientious person, set on helping the people around them and promoting unity. They would be very serious and polite, and would hold others to the same standard. A few close friends would suit them better than a large number of associates, but at the end of the day the Seer of Blood could thrive with either. While not especially popular, they would be very well-liked by those close to them.

Ascension would be unlikely for a Seer of Blood, but not impossible. Their more passive nature means that they would not be in battle especially often and as such don’t need the decreased mortality rate associated with Godhood. Their love of their friends means that they would try to avoid dying so as not to hurt them - but if their friends depended on the them reaching Godhood, nothing would be able to stop the Seer of Blood from Ascending.

Post God-tiering, they would be an unstoppable unifying force. Using their inherent knowledge of the bonds of enemies, they would be able to convince foes to become allies. No one could so much as think about betraying their team without the Seer of Blood catching on. 

The inversion of a Seer of Blood would be a Witch of Breath: one who actively manipulates freedom, change, and wind.

The potential land of a Seer of Blood might be LOPAB, or the Land of Pulse and Bonds. The thick roots and branches of this dense forest planet are all interconnected, and snake-like consorts live amongst the vines. They all secretly want to be friends with their neighbors, but have been brought up to distrust everyone and anyone. The Seer of Blood must figure out which consorts might be willing to trust others and link friendships like a paper chain - but discretely, as the snakes don’t trust the Seer either. Once enough of the snakes have seen the error of their ways they’ll be willing to work with the Seer to find their Denizen.

The strife specibi of Seers tend to be thin, pointed, jabbing weapons, but Blood players tend to pick items related to their ideal career path. As the two are not mutually exclusive, finding something for the Seer of Blood to equip to their strife deck ought to be relatively simple.

Their greatest strengths would be their concern for others and powerful strategic abilities, but their greatest weakness would be their relative weakness in battle.

The special ability of a Seer of Blood would be Ultimate Team Arrangements! By seeing exactly who would be best suited to work with whom, the Seer of Blood would be able to match teammates together to achieve the strongest possible friendships and ideal work partners. Unity and responsibility are front and center with the Seer of Blood
