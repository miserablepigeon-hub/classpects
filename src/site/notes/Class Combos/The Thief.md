## [Role of the Taker - The Thief]

Those born with the **Role of the Thief** are lone wolves. With a strong set of ideals, they cannot be easily dissuaded once they have made their mind about something, and aren’t afraid to break rules or cheat the system if they need to. All is fair in order to achieve their goal.  They are straightforward, blunt, to the point, with no time to waste, and always have their hands full with something. While they can form part of a group and form bonds with others, their values and nature may conflict with them, and they run the risk of manipulating and using others if they don’t trust and respect them as equals. The bonds a Thief does make, however, are intense due to their extreme selectiveness, and losing one of these bonds can be stressful and devastating for them. At their best, they’re energetic, fearless and ready to take action at a moment’s notice. At their worst, they can be egotistical and cocky.  
  
Thieves may have a perceived lack of their **Aspect** to begin with, which will often challenge them. Something they’re missing and they struggle with, something they must learn to take from the environment, from others. This doesn’t, however, mean that they need to stay with others to mature, as their need to take their Aspect plays into their lone wolf nature, bettering themselves, building themselves up, and becoming a powerhouse on their own. They’re as powerful going solo as they are in a team, however their companions should be wary of being left behind, and used as stepping stones to further their goals. Trust and respect are crucial for a Thief to be reliable, but with a strong enough bond, they can become one of the most powerful teammates you could hope for.  
  
Being one of the Taker Classes, Thieves are the Active counterpart to [[Class Combos/The Rogue\|The Rogue]], and similar to them, their strengths lie in **Stealing**. Taking or Receiving their Aspects from others and from any fitting source to benefit themselves, they are all about strengthening themselves and amassing more and more. This works doubly in their favor, improving their lack of their Aspect while reducing its amount on their foes, they can fend themselves against the strongest of enemies. A Thief should be aware and careful of not going overboard, however, as where they Steal from, they may leave only Lack.
