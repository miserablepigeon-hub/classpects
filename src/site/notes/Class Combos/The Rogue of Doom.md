Rogues are the passive half of the Allocation classes, with their counterparts being the more active Thieves. They are generally easygoing, friendly, well-liked, and well-known for their relationships - failed or otherwise. Rogues possess the ability to steal their aspect, but rather than keeping it for themselves they redistribute it to where it is either most needed or most lacking. They have been called the Robin Hood of classes.

Doom is the aspect of death, sacrifice, rules, order, and authority. Its counterpart is Life. Doom players tend to lose the most of all the aspects - due to the power of their sacrifices - and have a love of order. An interest in computer coding, following the instructions for Lego sets, or paint by number art books would be right up a Doom player’s alley. Though Doom seems like a gloomy aspect, it’s quite possible to be a peppy, cheerful Doom player.

The Rogue of Doom would have the ability to steal order and authority away from things, or to implement it in places where it is lacking. At the highest level, they could even go so far as to steal death away from their teammates and redirect it at their opponents. Though such a method would doubtlessly have limitations to stop them from being utterly game-breaking, the Rogue of Doom is still quite a useful player to have on hand.

The role of a Rogue of Doom in a typical Sburb session would be a passive one; finding teammates lacking in order or unwilling to sacrifice anything and redistributing their Aspect accordingly.

Prior to God-Tiering the Rogue of Doom would be serious and rule oriented, but still affable and relatively easy to befriend. Their odd habits about cleanliness may be an in-joke amongst their friends, as the Rogue of Doom would probably be one of those types who would have some of their spaces immaculately tidy (such as their bedroom or desk), while some of their other spaces have objects flung about as though a hurricane had passed through.

Ascension is not especially likely for this Title, but should they decide to undergo it they are well suited to the challenge. Doom player’s understanding of sacrifice and death means that the Rogue of Doom could give up their life with relatively few problems, if they felt the need to.

Post God-Tiering, this Title could potentially make short work of the Derse royalty. By stealing their authority they could cause the rest of the soldiers to turn against them. They could also keep allies from violently turning against the group by instituting a sense of order and dedication to rules over the rest of the team - possibly without even meaning to!

The inversion of a Rogue of Doom is a Knight of Life: one who actively manipulates energy, rebellion and healing.

The potential land of a Rogue of Doom might be LONAE, or the Land of Night and Entropy. This dark world barely seems to take in any of Skaia’s light, and is instead marked by a calm darkness in which nocturnal life forms thrive. The fruit bat consorts of this dense forest planet are in a near constant state of frenzied panic, as the edges of their forest are beginning to decay and that onslaught of dying trees only gets closer and closer to their villages as time goes on. The Rogue of Doom must steal the inevitability and death from the dying trees and redirect some of that order to the poor frantic and disorganized bats. 

In terms of Strife Specibi, Rogues tend to use long, thin, two-handed weapons, while Doom players aren’t known to use weapons at all. A rifle, blades, some kind of pole-arm, or even just a stick could do nicely.
Their greatest strength would be their orderly and affable nature, but their greatest weakness would be strict adherence to those rules in situations where it might not apply.

The special ability of a Rogue of Doom would be rule-swapping pranks! While keeping one’s hands and arms close to one’s body is a sound move on a roller coaster, it’s a poor decision during a dance contest. The Rogue could swap people’s perception of given orders, leading to some pretty hilarious pranks in potentia!
