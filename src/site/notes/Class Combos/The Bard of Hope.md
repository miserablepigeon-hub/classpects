Bards are the passive half of the destruction classes, with their counterpart being the more active Princes. They invite destruction through/of their aspect, but so long as that destruction is pointed in the right direction (toward the enemy) they can be wonderful allies. Like Princes, they spend a lot of time inverted due to their roles as destroyers of their aspect - however they must learn to embrace their aspect even as they destroy it. Bards are known as the 'Wild Card' of classes, and their presence in a session can lead a team to either great fortune or massive disaster. 

Hope is the aspect of faith, motivation, goals, positive emotion, willpower, unlimited choices, and belief. It’s counterpart is Rage. Ironically, Hope has strong associations with science in spite of being the aspect of faith. Though Hope is arguably the most powerful aspect it is notoriously difficult to use to its full potential. Hope players are often obnoxiously chipper, and entirely set in their beliefs with no chance of being swayed. An important milestone in a Hope player’s growth is falling into despair. Despair is something every Hope player must face, and it’s the player’s decision to rise above it (or not) that defines them and makes them powerful

The Bard of Hope would have the ability to passively destroy hope, or allow hope to cause destruction. Bards tend to have truly stunning strength when attacking, but their use of that strength is unreliable at best.They could use their phenomenal hope abilities to power dangerous attacks, or use enemies' false hope to lead them to disaster

Their role in a typical Sburb session is a passive one; Bards are best suited to focusing on their planet quest, maturing emotionally, and increasing their strength before going on to fight the Derse royalty. While their incredible strength makes them a powerful fighter, the Bard can be dangerously unreliable, and so should not be overused.

Prior to God-tiering, the Bard of Hope would most likely be a very grumpy, shouty, and all around irritable person, due to their role as a destroyer class inverting their aspect. In spite of this, they still would be a person with clear goals, motivation, and faith in themselves

Ascension for a Bard of Hope is either a sure thing, or completely impossible. By reaching godhood they could destroy the Hope of their opponents, but by failing to do so they would destroy the Hope of their allies. Regarding the emotional aspect, Bards are so unpredictable (with Hope acting as an especially unpredictable aspect) that they might chicken out just as easily as offing themselves without a second thought.

Post God-tiering, the Bard of Hope would be an unstoppable tornado of faith and demolition. At this point there's not much any of the Bard's teammates can do other than pray that the Bard of Hope was well-developed and emotionally matured enough to keep a handle on themselves and not turn on their teammates.

The inversion of a Bard of Hope is a Maid of Rage; one who actively creates negative emotions, anger, and limited choices.

The potential Land of a Bard of Hope might be LODAD, or the Land of Doves and Demons. This planet resembles a ball of birdseed, and the consorts seem to be snow-white doves... but the demonic-looking lizard beasts that roam the land claim to be the consorts as well. They may just be lying through their jagged, pointy teeth, or maybe the doves aren't quite what they seem? The Bard of Hope must discover which group is the impostor, uncover their goal, and destroy any hope of their plan succeeding. Be careful, though - the impostors aren't who you think.

The strife specibi of Bards tends to be limited to items of strong personal value, but all Hope players use a gun of some sort. Pistolkind, riflekind, harpoongunkind, and minigunkind are all possibilities, but alchemizing them with a personal item might make them better.

Their greatest strength and greatest weakness are one and the same; their unpredictability can work wonders!

Their special power would be de-motivational speeches! While a good pep talk can raise armies, the power to de-moralize through speech can stop wars and quell injustice, making it an extremely useful tool!
