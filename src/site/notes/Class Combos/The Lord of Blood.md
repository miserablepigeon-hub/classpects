Lords are the active half of the two Master Classes, and their counterparts are the more passive Muses. Lords possess the combined powers of all of the active basic classes (Knight, Mage, Thief, Witch, Maid, and Prince). They are the most active of all the classes, and little is known about them. They are extremely powerful, and are constantly doing something - they would never let anyone else outdo them for even a moment.

Blood is the aspect of unity, family, bonds, friendship, and responsibility. It’s counterpart is Breath. Blood players tend to be overly serious - often to a laughable point. Blood players may also have unique physical blood - such as a mutation, rare blood type, or disease - or a unique bloodline/ family tree.

The Lord of Blood would have the ability to completely control emotional bonds, friendship, unity, and responsibility. While this particular title is not overly likely to abuse their power in a tyrannical fit of dominance, they are still not someone to pick a fight with. They would likely be very fair and rule-oriented, but still frighteningly powerful. The Lord of Blood has a uniquely active class paired with a very group-oriented aspect, making for an interesting balance.

No session with a Muse or Lord could be called typical, but the role of a Lord of Blood in an Sburb session is an active one; creating, destroying, and altering bonds and responsibility.

Prior to God-tiering, the Lord of Blood would be a superb example of a 'by-the-book' thinker. They follow the rules to the letter and expect others to do the same - an emotionally immature Lord of Blood might throw a grand scale temper tantrum if someone cheats at something or acts disrespectfully. However, they highly value their friendships and always put their families first - or at least they value their own end of these relationships. 

Ascension for a Lord of Blood is a rather straightforward affair, as it is with most Lords. They would likely have few - if any - qualms about facing death for more power. If there was even the slightest indication that any of their friends or family wanted them to go through with it then their minds would be completely made up. 

Post God-tiering, the Lord of Blood would be an unstoppable force of family and bonds. They might just end up creating an entire universe full of friendship and responsibility, making hatred and carelessness into incomprehensible ideas. They might just as easily destroy their aspect entirely though, so watch out.

The inversion of a Lord of Blood is a Muse of Breath; one who passively embodies freedom, change, and wind.

There is not enough information about either of the Master Classes to theorize on their potential lands. Just know that their quest would be extreme. 

Blood players tend to pick items that are related to their ideal career paths, but Lords are strong enough to make a singular paperclip stronger than a nuclear weapon, so really anything can work for this class.

Their greatest strength is their incredible power, but their greatest weakness is their refusal to take a back seat and let others work on things.
The special ability of a Lord of Blood is completely controlling unity, family, bonds, friendship, and responsibility. Why yes, that is the same as their regular ability. The Lord of Blood is already special.
