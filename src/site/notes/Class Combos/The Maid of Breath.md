Maids are the active half of the Creation classes, with their counterpart being the more passive Sylphs. They create, spread, and shamelessly promote their aspect, but do so more easily if they do it for themselves. It’s almost as if they were ‘maid’ of their aspect. (Get it? ‘Cause ‘maid’ sounds like ‘made’? Bweheheheheheh~) They are often mistaken for a passive class due to the fact that their efforts often go unnoticed or overlooked. A well-developed Maid must learn to accept this lack of acknowledgment.

Breath is the aspect of wind, freedom, change, and confidence. It’s counterpart is Blood. Breath players tend to be extremely difficult to control or manipulate, even if it’s for their own good.

The Maid of Breath would be able to create freedom and change wherever they saw fit. While the Maid of Breath is hardly a skilled fighter, they are a very powerful class in that they are unlikely to be contained or brought down by the negative effects of Sburb, and can share that freedom with their teammates.

The role of a Maid of Breath in a session is an active one, though it may not seem that way. They must locate the components of the game that constrain their teammates and create freedom to replace these components, clear out the obstacles holding back their teammates (thus increasing their freedom,) and prevent stagnation or stalemates where possible. A Seer would be a welcome companion for this Title; as one who could uncover the location and/or nature of any disruptions to the game's natural course, their guidance would greatly lighten the Maid's load.

Prior to God-tiering, Maid of Breath would most likely not be able to sit still for very long and would constantly start large projects without finishing them. Being a near embodiment of freedom, change, and confidence means that they'll never be fully satisfied with what they have, so long as something different exists. They would almost certainly be friendly and kind, as well.

Ascension is always a challenge, but the Maid of Breath would likely embrace the change, both in power and mortality. It seems more likely that they would be killed on their quest bed than killing themselves, but Breath players are often unpredictable and the Maid is no exception

Post God-tiering, they would spend a lot more time alone, trying to more fully embrace their freedom. A Maid of Breath would probably adjust well to the lack of recognition Maids usually get for their efforts, as a positive result of their 'roll with it' attitude

The inverse of a Maid of Breath is a Bard of Blood; one who passively destroys unity, responsibility, and familial bonds.

The potential land of a Maid of Breath might be LOSAS, or the Land of Sky and Spirit. This bright blue planet is dotted with little cloud cities, but the minds of the slug-like consorts have been clouded by the denizen, and they are not allowed to even think without its permission. The Maid of Breath must free the consorts' minds while keeping both the freed consorts and themselves from being noticed. 

Maids rarely seem to use their strife specibus, but their strife decks are usually equipped with unconventional weapons suited to their ideal career paths. Breath players tend to pick their weapons based on their interests or by what's near them while they're playing with their strife deck, so the options for the Maid of Breath are practically infinite! If you want to get literal though, you could go for something like broomkind, fankind, mopkind, leafblowerkind, or dusterkind. 

Their greatest strength is ability to adapt to new situations and concepts, but their greatest weakness is their inability to follow through with their plans.

The special power  of a Maid of Breath is the ability to never be trapped. Backed into a corner? Turns out there's a secret passage right behind you. Giant cage dropped on you from above? The bars are spaced juuusssst wide enough for you to squeeze through. In handcuffs in the back of a police vehicle? By pure coincidence the officer who cuffed you used his child's fake handcuffs by mistake, and his partner forgot to shut the door properly. Being the personification of freedom sure can be nice sometimes.
