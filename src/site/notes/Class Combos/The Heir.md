## [Role of the Innovator - The Heir]

Those born with the **Role of the Heir** are bound to malleability. They aren’t just open to changing themselves, they are also heavily inclined to influence change in others. This knack to affect others may not present itself directly, but something of their own or related to them could hold a similar effect. Heirs are open, yet care about others and the impact they may have on them enough to hide facets of themselves, things that could drag their partners down or make them uncomfortable. Those who dismiss the influence they hold upon others can, unwittingly or otherwise, become a detriment to the rest. And as change permeates their lives, these tend to build up and escalate towards a defining moment or series of defining moments that truly alter them, and that will shape who they are and how they interact with others. At their best, they are friendly, understanding and caring of their friends. At their worst, they can be distant, stuck-up and easily manipulable.  
  
Heirs are at risk of losing themselves to their **Aspect** if they allow it to influence and change them enough. Their Heir’s Aspect factors heavily in their environment, being a main source of influence in their lives, and culminating in this defining change they may inherit. As such, they need to grow and mature, to learn to take hold of their Aspect before they’re irreparably changed by it, making their will and goals important to hold on to. A confident, determined Heir is a powerful and versatile force that can accomplish anything they put their mind into and can shift the tides of battle in a heartbeat, but they shouldn’t lose sight of what’s important for them, lest they lose themselves.  
  
Being one of the Innovator Classes, Heirs are the Passive counterpart to [[Class Combos/The Witch\|The Witch]], and similar to them, their strengths lie in **Changing** things. Manipulating, Converting and otherwise Controlling their Aspect, they are adept at shaping their powers and shifting them to suit them in battle. Heirs may allow their Aspect to flow through them and shape them but they’ll occasionally take direct control of their powers to attack. They can easily contribute to any situation, as they are adaptable and good at keeping up with the rest of their group. Don’t take a Heir lightly, even those who are more carefree may bite back if pressed too far.
