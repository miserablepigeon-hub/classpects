Princes are the active half of the destruction class, with their counterparts being the more passive Bards. Princes tend to be self-aggrandizing and overestimate their own ability, but in their defense they are usually very skilled at their work. Princes and Bards alike spend a majority of their time inverting their aspect due to their roles as destroyers, but must learn to embrace their aspect even as they destroy it.
Light is the aspect of information, relevance, clarity, and luck. Its counterpart is Void. Light players tend to be clever and goal-oriented, often with a love of attention (or being in the spot-light. Heheheheh).

The Prince of Light would have the ability to destroy information and luck, or to use information and luck as a tool to destroy other things. So long as their annihilation of their aspect was pointed in the right direction - at the opponent, rather than teammates - the Prince of Light would make a wonderful ally and a strong fighter. Should they turn their back on their team though, a Prince of Light could mean the end of the other players' chances of winning at all.

The role of a Prince of Light in a typical Sburb session is an active one: taking out imps, destroying the enemies' luck, destroying the information enemies have on how to fight back, and fighting the Derse royalty.

Prior to God-tiering, a Prince of Light would behave much more like a Void player than a Light player. Their ability to casually obliterate information and clarity in others would make the Prince of Light an altogether confounding person to interact with. They would probably be a very secretive, manipulative sort of person - though their incredible manipulation skills would not stem from a desire to control others so much as it would stem from just trying to accomplish goals efficiently. Poor fortune would run rampant amongst their friends and family, as a negative side effect of the Prince's skill set.

Ascension would be an especially trying endeavor for the Prince of Light. Their role as an active fighter means that they would definitely want the power boost and lower fatality rate that comes with God-tiering, but their bad luck and lack of information would make it very difficult - if not impossible - for them to reach their quest bed in the first place.

Post God-tiering, they would have a nearly unparalleled fighting ability - certainly unmatched by anyone in their session. They may gain the finesse to redirect their bad luck away from themselves, though this may not happen until they mature emotionally.

The inversion of a Prince of Light is a Sylph of Void; one who passively heals mystery, secrets, nothingness, and depth.

The potential land of a Prince of Light might be LOMAM, or the Land of Mirrors and Mirage. The reflective surface of this planet reflects the light of Skaia and morphs it into images of things that may, or never will happen. Destroying the mirrors only fragments them, leading to more grotesque illusions. Only by cutting off all light reaching the planet can the Prince of Light uncover the secrets of his consorts and denizen.

Princes use powerful weapons that they received as gifts or had handed down to them, while Light players often use cards or dice. Dicekind, 8-ballkind, or tarotkind could work, but an individual, unique, inherited weapon would be better.

Their greatest strength is their intense attack power, but their greatest weakness is their awful luck.

The special power of a Prince of Light is destroying an enemy's luck entirely. It's easy to win a fight if your opponent is hit by a car or crushed by a piano before they even show up.
