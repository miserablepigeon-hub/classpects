Sylphs are the passive half of the Creation class, with their counterparts being the more active Maids. Sylphs heal, repair, and replenish their aspect, or physically heal teammates using their aspect as a power source. They are often the 'moms' of the team - nosily involving themselves in everything and giving unrequested advice. The Sylph must learn when their help is wanted though; forcing their help will only exacerbate teammates' problems, no matter what the Sylph's intentions were. Though may get on a few nerves, Sylphs do genuinely mean well and care deeply for their teammates. Expect them to be analytical and more than a little self-righteous. Some motormouth tendencies would not be a surprise.

Heart is the aspect of Love, Passion, Individuality, and Soul. It’s counterpart is Mind. Heart players may be passionate and illogical, embracing an idea with little to no logical evidence. They are most likely cheerful and very friendly. Unfortunately, Heart players are doomed to have at least one completely disastrous relationship (or an unrequited love), and tend to have splintered personalities that show themselves through roleplay, mood swings, or copies of themselves.

The Sylph of Heart would have the ability to heal passion and individuality. They are essentially the ultimate therapist - healing a person's sense of worth and individuality as well as repairing their emotional responses would make the Sylph of Heart an ideal ally in a game as traumatizing as Sburb. 

The role of a Sylph of Heart in a typical Sburb session is a passive one: healing the physical injuries of teammates, guiding teammates through romantic or personal breakdowns, and fighting the Derse royalty.  Beware though - while Sylphs may seem to be the very definition of a passive class, their melee fighting ability is shockingly potent and they can wreak a lot of havoc.

Prior to God-tiering, the Sylph of Heart would be a hopeless romantic who loved playing matchmaker. They would probably have a large group of associates with a few truly close friends. The Sylph would be the go-to person for romantic problems, emotional problems, self-esteem problems, and dozens of other problems, which is a role that the Sylph would happily accept. Should someone disregard their advice though, they may feel personally insulted and become bitter about it.

Ascension is usually difficult, but Sylphs are usually headstrong, and Heart players can get really set on something once they've gotten it into their head. With that in mind, a Sylph of Heart who wants to reach Godhood would sprint straight to their Quest Bed and kill themselves without a backward glance - but a Sylph of Heart who did not want to go through with it would be all but impossible to convince.

Post God-tiering, a Sylph of Heart would be a powerful force to reckon with. They could keep all of their allies healthy and positive, limit their own mortality rate, and help fight the Derse royalty.

The inversion of a Sylph of Heart is a Prince of Mind; one who actively destroys choices, thought, and intelligence

The potential land of a Sylph of Heart might be LOPAP, or the Land of Pillows and Parties. The plush, downy surface of this patchwork planet is dotted with the pillow-fort dance parties of the fluffy chinchilla consorts. However, there's a problem! Due to the meddling of the denizen, the chinchillas all suppress their personalities and emotions in an attempt to seem cool and win the eye of their crush - but they're simultaneously confused and hurt because their crush is also acting so cold and emotionless! The Sylph of Heart must fix the chinchillas' unhealthy view of romance, heal their self-esteem and individuality, and eventually repair their broken hearts. (They can act as a matchmaker for the chinchillas as well, if they can find the time.)

Sylphs can have any type of weapon, but said weapon always transforms in some way - lipstick can become a chainsaw or dice can change shape based on the roll. Heart players tend to prefer handheld slicing weapons, but that's really more of a guideline than a rule. Bladekind, clawkind, axekind, or razorkind  are all options. As for potential transformations, the possibilities are endless!

The greatest strengths of a Sylph of Heart are their kindness and devotion to their team, but their greatest weaknesses are their hubris and nosiness.
