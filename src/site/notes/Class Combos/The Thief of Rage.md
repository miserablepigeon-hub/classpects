Thieves are the active half of the allocation classes, with their counterpart being the passive Rogues. They move their aspect from one location to another, often hoarding it for themselves. Thieves tend to be dramatic and self-righteous, so it is often difficult for them to keep friends, in spite of their charisma.

Rage is the aspect of negative emotions, unpredictability, limited choices, and conviction. Its counterpart is Hope. Rage has associations with religion, which is odd in that the aspect of faith, Hope, is its opposite. In spite of its reputation as 'bad' or 'evil', Rage is just as necessary as any other aspect and just as likely to be good.

A Thief of Rage has the ability to steal Rage in the form of negative emotions or limited choices from enemies or allies and attribute it to themselves. While this may seem disadvantageous to the Thief, the ability to take an enemy's conviction to fight is a useful skill to have - more so if applied strategically. 

The role of a Thief of Rage in a typical session would be an active one; taking out imps, stealing enemies' conviction, and fighting the Derse royalty. Though they possess the ability to act as a group mediator (stealing allies' negative emotions), doing so would be dangerously close to their inverted role, and so should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.

Prior to God-tiering, a Thief of Rage would be a bit of a show-off, and would probably enjoy trolling people or bringing down peoples' good moods (stealing enjoyment through Rage). They would not have many - if any - really close friends, but would definitely have many acquaintances.

Ascension is usually fairly difficult, and that holds true for the Thief of Rage. Luckily their conviction and limited options would keep them from worrying over it for too long. 

Post God-tiering they would have stronger powers, and would probably use it selfishly, at least at first. Trolling more people, harder, with less effort is just too much fun to pass up.

The inversion of a Thief of Rage is a Page of Hope; one who passively exploits positive emotion, harmony, and faith.

The potential land of a Thief of Rage might be LOMAT, or the Land of Markets and Tension. The mistrustful consorts of this vast, maze-like planet each have a market stall with goods to sell, but each is suspicious of their neighbor for potentially stealing their merchandise. The Thief of Rage must enrage certain shopkeepers to the point of violence, and steal the necessary items during the commotion. However, should they incite too much anger the ensuing fights will collapse entire portions of the marketplace, making their scavenger hunt much more difficult. As such they must steal the anger of the shopkeepers with useless items, but still maintain their temper enough to finish their task. 

Upon reaching God-tier, the Thief of Rage might not even need a strife-specibus because they could just prevent opponents from fighting in the first place by limiting their options. For those who still need one, long stabbing weapons seem to work well for Thieves, while religious paraphernalia better suits Rage players. Canekind, swordkind, spearkind, nativitykind, fncysntakind, clubkind, crosskind, or buddhastatuekind might work. Alchemizing different weapons together might work too. 

Their greatest strength would be their versatility, but their greatest weakness is a lack of teamwork and misunderstanding themselves.

Their special ability would be very similar to the incredible Hulk. But instead of just becoming monstrous and angry, The Thief of Rage would have all of their own anger combined with their enemies' anger, turning any fight into a curb-stomp battle.
