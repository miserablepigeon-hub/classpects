Rogues are the passive half of the Allocation classes, with their counterparts being the more active Thieves. They are generally easygoing, friendly, well-liked, and well-known for their relationships - failed or otherwise. Rogues possess the ability to steal their aspect, but rather than keeping it for themselves they redistribute it to where it is either most needed or most lacking. They have been called the Robin Hood of classes.

Rage is the aspect of negative emotions, unpredictability, limited choices, and conviction. Its counterpart is Hope. Rage has associations with religion, which is odd in that the aspect of faith, Hope, is its opposite. In spite of its reputation as ‘bad’ or ‘evil’, Rage is just as necessary as any other aspect and just as likely to be good.

The Rogue of Rage would have the ability to redistribute anger and negativity to benefit themselves and their teammates. They might enrage enemies to lower their strategic ability, or increase allies' anger to increase their strength. Either way, the Rogue of Rage is a useful person to have around.

The role of a Rogue of Rage in a typical Sburb session would be a passive one; finding teammates lacking in conviction or overwhelmed by negativity and redistributing their Aspect accordingly.

Prior to God-tiering, the Rogue of Rage would be a grumpy person with a deep love of complaining, but their mellow, laid-back nature would make them popular amongst friends. They would be the person to go to as a sounding board for an angry rant, complaint, or slam poetry session. Expect them to be very sweet at heart (but still just as grumpy as they are on the surface).

Ascension would be fairly unlikely for a Rogue of Rage, due to their passive, take-it-as-it-comes nature. However, it's still a definite possibility as their aspect provides them with more than enough conviction to go through with it.

Post God-tiering, the Rogue of Rage would be a powerful ally with a fairly small chance of turning on their team. They would be the irritable glue holding everyone together and keeping them determined to win. While their fighting abilities are nothing to write home about, their skills can easily turn the tide of war and prevent unnecessary bloodshed.

The inversion of a Rogue of Rage is a Knight of Hope; one who actively exploits or weaponizes positive emotion, harmony, and faith.

The potential land of a Rogue of Rage might be LOOAV, or the Land of Outbursts and Violence. The horned toad consorts of this dry, desert planet are always losing their tempers - and they get violent when they do. The Rogue of Rage must passively accept this, and redistribute the anger of the consorts near them to the ones further away to stay out of trouble. Only by mastering this technique can they investigate the land and unlock the riddles that lead to their denizen.

Rogues prefer to use their hands or glove based weapons for their strife-specibus, but Rage players are often more comfortable with religious paraphernalia. Maybe tie a menorah to a boxing glove? I don't know. I just don't know.

Their greatest strength is their easy-going grumpiness, but their greatest weakness would stem from losing their temper from taunts about their title sounding like 'Road Rage.' 

The special ability of a Rogue of Rage would be Ultimate Public Approval! No person will ever disapprove of the Rogue of Rage's actions or personality again. All they have to do is steal the public's negative emotions and redirect them elsewhere. The people are happy, and the polls have never been higher! Smart move, Rogue of Rage!
