## [[Class Combos/The Sylph\|The Sylph]]

Usually known as a Healer Class, and occasionally paired with the Witch Class as its Active Counterpart, the Sylph has way more uses than merely Healing, and more similarities with the Maid than with the Witch. **Making** is its primary function, and while Healing falls under that same Spectrum, Creation and Improvement in general are powers that often fall under the Sylph’s domain

## [[Class Combos/The Maid\|The Maid]]

Similarly, the Maid is often paired with the Heir Class, and the similarities are there- But their ties to Creation, Faes and their consistent show of Self-Resurrection peg the two as strong counterparts. Much like the Sylph, Maids **Make** and, metaphorically speaking at least, are **Made** **of** their Aspect. Whatever this means for each Aspect can be fuzzy, but the wordplay is presented quite interestingly. Maids often begin their journey oppressed by their Aspect in some regard- But as an intrinsic part of themselves, they must get rid of their shackles and embrace the facets of their Aspect that make them up.

## [[Class Combos/The Knight\|The Knight]] 
The Knight is often considered an Active Class, and the counterpart to the Passive Page, and this makes sense- Knights seem more forward and to use their Aspects as a weapon more directly, while Pages are presented as a Weak Class that takes a long time to reach their Full Potential. However, this assumption of Active and Passive doesn’t quite match the canonical example of some other Classes, and as such, this is under the assumption that Active Classes benefit themselves primarily, while Passive Classes benefit others. As such, the Knights present themselves, visibly, as a Class meant to **Serve** others, to come in their aid and protect them, even to the point of hiding their flaws and pushing themselves to seem more dependable.

## [[Class Combos/The Page\|The Page]]

Similarly, the Page is usually seen as a Passive Class, however the canonical example has shown of almost oblivious or innocent individuals who’re often helped by others- A Class that benefits from having others **Serve them**, help build them up, and once they achieve their full potential, use their immense stockpile of power to **Serve** their enemies an unexpected defeat.

## [[Class Combos/The Seer\|The Seer]]

The Seer is one of the most explored Classes in Homestuck, with two great canon examples, and a third rather interesting case as well. The Passive counterpart to the Mage, Seers **Know** their Aspect, and through their Aspect, guiding those around them.

## [[Class Combos/The Mage\|The Mage]]

The Mage is a Class with a bit of a stigma in the Fandom, with the conception that Mages ‘suffer’ their Aspect, which doesn’t necessarily seem to be true, specially given the most popular Mage we see is the Mage of Doom- Literally one who **Knows** suffering, which may have muddled the conception of this Class. Unlike Seers, who seem to guide others through what they Know and See, Mages seem to have a more intrinsic and instinctual understanding of their Aspect, and may be biased in how they show others what to do. More prone to Act on what they Know, rather than Guiding those around them.

## [[Class Combos/The Heir\|The Heir]]

Heirs can be a confusing Class, they’re occasionally paired with the Maid, which somewhat makes sense thematically, in the consideration that Maids are ‘Made of’ their Aspect, and many people think the Heirs ‘Become’ their Aspect. It is true that Heirs are bound to Inherit a great power, however, their common themes link them more to the Witch than the Maid. They’re Magicians, often shown commanding a Familiar, and their power is that of **Change**, of Changing through their Aspect, with this Inherited Power being a **Change** to their own person, something they may bear, lest their Aspect consume them.

## [[Class Combos/The Witch\|The Witch]]

Similarly, the Witch is often paired with the Sylph, specially under the idea that Sylphs are just ‘More Magic Witches’. However, much like the Heir, they share the thematic of the Familiar, but rather than being a more clear divide, the Familiar and the Witch’s relation is a bit different. The Familiar may grant power to the Witch, who must in turn overcome the Will of the Familiar, just like how the Heir is at risk of losing themselves to their Aspect itself, the Witch is at risk of losing themselves to their Familiar. Whether they’ve overcome their Familiar and taken their power, or given in to them and their Will, Witches are a powerful Class able to Manipulate their Aspect, to use it to **Change** and Change their Aspect itself

## [[Class Combos/The Rogue\|The Rogue]]

The Rogue is a pretty straight forward Class, they’re **Stealers** of their Aspect, but with their Passive Alignment, they’re more often than not Stealing for the benefit of others, giving them a sort of Robin Hood-esque stereotype. Often at odds with society, they can be quite lonesome, but they hold those they like dear and are incredibly fond of the ones they care about.

## [[Class Combos/The Thief\|The Thief]]

There’s a bit of a stigma against Thieves. Just like Rogues, they **Steal**, however they’re doing it for their own benefit. This leads many to think of them as self-centered and extremely selfish, and while definitely a possibility, they don’t have to be like that. Just like the Rogue, they’re highly attached to those they respect, but they put a great deal of confidence in their own way of being. They won’t stop at anything, even if they have to cheat, to accomplish their goal, which may occasionally distance them from their group if they go too far, which is not to say they themselves won’t regret that loss just the same.

## [[Class Combos/The Bard\|The Bard]]

Often described as a Wildcard, Bards are a very particular Class, and not many people seem to like it. With the two canon examples of the Bard not being exactly the most appealing, they’re often seen as that weirdo Class you don’t really want to get in a Class Quiz, but there’s nothing wrong with it. Bards seem to hold dear a set of ideals deep within their heart, something that empowers them and drives them, and having this ideal shattered can lead to an identity crisis. These ideals will often be what the Bard considers as Good, and as such, what most of their Selfless Efforts will be in regard to. As such, whether they act for the good of the team or not depends on how their ideals align with that of the group. As the Passive **Destroyer**, they Destroy their Aspect for the Benefit of Others, and Destroy Through their Aspect. Also said to Allow the Destruction of their Aspect, it’s no wonder such a Class is considered unpredictable, but to themselves, all of their Actions have a meaning

## [[Class Combos/The Prince\|The Prince]]

Much like the Thief, the Prince is often seen in a bad light because of them being an Active **Destroyer**, for their egos and attitude. However, Princes are not inherently bad in the slightest. They may struggle with themselves self just as much as others struggle with them, but a well developed Prince can be an immensely valuable ally and a protective and powerful friend. There’s also the misconception of them appearing as their Opposite Aspect given they Destroy their Aspect, but this is not exactly true, and a Prince is just as likely to Destroy using their Aspect as they are to Destroy their Aspect.

## [[Class Combos/The Muse\|The Muse]]

Often seen as a Martyr, many believe the Muse is completely incapable of using their powers in a Direct way, but this is not true. While often having to endure a lot, the Muse is a **Commander** of their Aspect just as the Lord is, and while they bear through and grit their teeth when something happens to them, they will move mountains to aid that which they care about. Underestimate a Muse for their Passivity, and you will have to face, not just their power, but that of everyone they’re fighting alongside with

## [[Class Combos/The Lord\|The Lord]]

Often seen as the most Powerful God Tier, but like any other Class, they have their flaws and limits. Lords are stereotyped as inherently evil, but that doesn’t have to be the case. With their positions of high power and their sphere of influence, it’s very easy for those prone to do evil to be corrupted by this amount of power- But those with a better view of the world and people they actually care about can become powerful **Commanders** of their Aspect for a righteous cause. Don’t fear someone because they are a Lord- All Tyrants fall in due time. If they’re good, you may never find a more capable ally. But if they’re not, no amount of power can overwhelm the Will of the Many.

the classes are simple if you break down the ideas connected to them, seeing the possible pieces you can use to make a title

titles are just simple descriptions of a character or person and don’t describe their entire selfand in the most literal sense use only 2 to 3 words to describe something, class of aspect. when figuring out a title, describe a person or character simply, use only one or two sentences and from that you can develop a title. it does take some practice, but beyond that it is a simple process in a simple and intuitive system

for story writers or character makers or classpectors, treat the title as a simple description of the character that more can be done with later. god of chaos and disorder, defender of the family, one who fights with the book, an old skilled scholar of the weird and unkown, the one who inspires brilliant young minds, a handyman that doesn anything to serve their boss, the one who shapes the soul, the one who overwrites or suppresses identity, these are a few of the many possible titles that can be turned into a classpect (or atleast one part of the aspect or class). now with the basics out of the way lets continue to defining everything  

There is no official source that describes all classes in one place, so this section is based nore on fragments of official information throught the homestuck stories, q&as, fan interpretation and more. Seeing the system and continuing the pattern

Prince & Bard

for me when i think of how bard is done in homestuck i see the key words bards (yeah it describes themselves), clown/ joker/ wild card, destroys indirectly

and for prince in homestuck i think the crown, fighting for their place, prince (you are telling me a prince is a prince), direct destruction

REMEMBER, OTHER CONNOTATIONS AROUND PRINCES AND BARDS CAN BE USED TO TITLE SOMEONE AS A PRINCE OR BARD. YOU DONT NEED TO FIT EVERY OR MOST IDEAS RELATING TO A CLASS, YOU JUST NEED ONE STRONG CONNECTION OR MANY SMALLER CONNECTIONS

Through those key words/ ideas i can think of a few personality traits that would have a princey or bardy character

for bard since its a joker, clown, wild card or someone who destroys indirectly i can see someone who

- plays jokes and keeps things mellow with it

- can go from serious to jokey or jokey to serious at a sudden flip (wild card)

- seems unpredictable or seems they can easily switch

- sees themselves as a joke or others consider them a joke

- undermines peoples operations or goals instead of directly stopping them (the indirect destruction which can destroy bad groups or conversations or destroy things people like or love)

- plays/ pretends to be the fool so everyone else feels better or so they can do what they wished in the background in peace  

and having some of these traits or having one strongly will make you seem more bardy
for prince since they are someone who seems royal, fights for their place, have the crown and directly destroy i can see someone who

- wants to (re)gain their title, power ability or control

- sees themselves as having high status or needing to earn their status

- tries to destroy or supress a topic or goal directly/ with their own might

- is serious/ tries to act higher/ acts as a better or royal person should/ restrains themselves to follow some sort of code or tries to act or feel superior

- generally being like a prince be it spoiled or very responsible and self controlled and having some of these traits or having one strongly will make you seem princely

Thieves & Rogues

for thieves its to take, amass, earn, steal, being a thief (ghasp), to only benefit yourself or your small group

for rogues its to take, being a rogue (oh my), amass, distribute, rebalance, give, to only benefit others or allow many to benefit

REMEMBER, OTHER CONNOTATIONS AROUND THIEVES AND ROGUES CAN BE USED TO TITLE SOMEONE AS A THIEF OR ROGUE. YOU DONT NEED TO FIT EVERY OR MOST IDEAS RELATING TO A CLASS, YOU JUST NEED ONE STRONG CONNECTION OR MANY SMALLER CONNECTIONS

for thief since they take, amass, earn, steal and try to benefit themselves or a small group i can see someone who

- tries to earn/ do everything themselves/ try to be self reliant
- takes what they want
- gathers as much as they can be it for pleasure or to feel secure
- someone who does what is necessary for their own goals (be it to betray a friend to keep your group safe or to cheat to keep yourself out of trouble or to take away something so another cant harm you)
- living by your own code or rules, helping only those of your kin having some of these traits or having one trait strongly will make you seem Thievy

breaking down the idea of mage and seer to see what connects to them when i see mages or atleast when i try to separate them from seers i view gandalf as the mage and the general oracles as seers, mages have knowledge but more often use themselves with the knowledge and a seer has knowledge but more often uses another with the knowledge.

  this idea is so flimsy though that i somewhat discard the idea of there being a clear barrier between the two just the concept of gandalf being a mage and oracles being seers

when i split the idea of mages i get knowing, searching, skilled, a sage who has had many years of practice, they often know stuff about their aspect, a mage/ sage doesnt need to scry they are already wise people

when i seperate the idea of seers i get seeing, scrying, learning, an oracle who can see your possible future,/ your actions/ your fate/ what is on your mind, the see stuff about their aspect, they can be a medium for other beings too

these two classes feel personally the hardest to separate (second hardest being thief and rogue) since they are often synonymous and can have the same tasks/ jobs or roles

though if i were to chart some behaviors or personality traits of a mage itd be someone who

- would be the guide journeying right besides you in life or your adventure, knowing the trail but not exactly giving instructions on how to chart it yourself, they help traverse the trail with you

- whatever question you may have they can help you find your answer or can already give you an answers (this doesnt mean they themselves think they are smart or knowing plenty but they could)

- known mostly for their seemingly innate knowledge, having researched a lot or having lots of experience from the past

- magic/ having some incredibly strong skill, they can do this task seemingly easier or faster than others, be it writing poems, conceptualizing stories, crafting machines, making paintings, making programs or understanding people

- being a wizard in some sense

though if i were to chart some behaviors or personality traits of a seer itd be someone who

- would be the one to tell you your options or to give you a path in your journey, could be right besides you though would more so be telling you how to solve the problem rather than solving it themselves or directly intervening

- whatever question you have they can try and look for an answer with you or try to look for an answer after searching for it in many places

- known mostly for the things they try to see, scry, learn about, gathering information, they dont so much have innate knowledge but seem to always be learning or looking for something new (this doesnt mean they dont have stuff learned from their previous searches though)

- seers can be magical, they are magicians after all, but their greatest feats are from giving insight to others or showing others the way, they dont necessarily have some very powerful skill like being able to make programs quickly or understanding their structure well but their special skill instead is on their knowledge seeking and giving it outwards or to move others with their insights (maybe they learn the weather will be bad and then advise others to plan some indoor activity or to prepare for bad weather and maybe even make a guide around it)

- being an oracle/ seer funnily enough does mean your skills are more people focused or has an impressive result when working with another, which means itll be easier for you to be meddlesome or messa round with people more
 

having some of these traits or having one trait strongly will make you seem seery

whether you only share the trait of telling others where to go or telling others what to do based on visions/ information and do that very often


or you have many small pieces of the seer traits but none of them by themselves seeming all that impressive

----- just simplify your description of yourself and see where it lands

remember we are people and have traits of multiple tropes/ categories

but by simplifying your view of self even for a moment you get to see what you describe yourself as and what trope that is

  

because honestly if you cant even describe yourself simply, how will you be able to describe yourself with two words

one class and one aspect

inversion is so odd since there are so many things you can do to avoid/ not be your class ro aspect

  

like not trying to be a joke/ making jokes for the bard"

or being more upfront instead of doing things behind the scenes

to avoid being all about the inner self and choose some other topic like what you made today

or to not look overly at identity and instead look at groups of people rather than the individual

or to reject breaking things so you end up protecting everything in sight

  

to fear the accidental harm you cause and then with everything youve got avoid breaking or dismantelling things or maybe even keep things safe from being torn down. protecting the parts of identity you used to weaken because you saw them as harmful, or to build up and encourage it

to take note on every way you break things and what people are inside, leaning more towards not breaking things and knowing a lot about the inner workings of people/ how they tick

its so broad, anything can come from it, well nearly

ofc you got the typical bard of heart to maid of mind, old school theoriest style

or if you go with more modern theories/ bascially canon the active creator class would be sylph, so sylph of mind

meddling to heal minds, logic, thoughts and paths
