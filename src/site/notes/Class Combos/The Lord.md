## [Role of the Master - The Lord]

Those born with the **Role of the Lord** are marked by power. They are a powerful and influential force on their environments and everyone they know. Whether by birthright or through hard work, Lords have earned, or will eventually earn a position of dominion over that which they desire. They are privileged, and for this, their biggest enemy is their own hubris. They may think everything is always meant to go their way, and take reckless risks or become conceited, yet the world always pushes back against someone who abuses their influence blatantly. With great power comes great responsibility, and this too is true of Lords, no matter how in control they think they are. At their best, they are persistent leaders with the power to lead themselves and others towards greatness, with the power to shape their future as they want. At their worst, they can be oppressive, egomaniacal abusers of their power.  
  
Lords hold an intense power over their **Aspect**, to the point they may in some cases shape it to an extent. They may consider themselves to be in a permanent position of leadership, but they should be careful about their actions. A Lord’s situation may pit those around them against their cause, if they exert their power too forcefully as to overwhelm and impose themselves, even those they may consider their friends could turn their backs. They can be a group’s greatest asset, and yet with such power, they can easily become tyrannical with both the Aspect they have influence on, and the people they exert their power on.  
  
Being one of the Master Classes, Lords are the most Active Class on the spectrum, as opposed to [[Class Combos/The Muse\|The Muse]]. And much like them, a Lord’s strengths lie in **Commanding**. They Rule, they Command over their Aspect with enough force to bend its will to suit them. They will always be favored by the very forces of nature they are in control of, and while this doesn’t mean they are untouchable or indestructible, it gives them an immense advantage. Their control of their Aspect is unparalleled, to the point their very rule may shape the reality surrounding them. Be careful if you’re opposed to a Lord, for their reign is absolute
