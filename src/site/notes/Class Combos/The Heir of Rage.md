Heirs are the passive half of the Manipulation classes, with their counterpart being Witches. They passively change, move around, or alter their aspect, and over time begin to completely embody it. Heirs tend to have very strong friendships, but don’t always act when they should.

Rage is the aspect of negative emotions, unpredictability, limited choices, and conviction. Its counterpart is Hope. Rage has associations with religion, which is odd in that the aspect of faith, Hope, is its opposite. In spite of its reputation as ‘bad’ or ‘evil’, Rage is just as necessary as any other aspect and just as likely to be good.

The Heir of Rage would have the ability to subconsciously control Rage. As their abilities increased or in moments of high stress, an Heir of Rage may literally become their aspect, though such a power is most likely outside of their control. Plus, what would that even look like? Becoming Rage? Would they just get super angry, or, like, spread themselves to other people, or what?

The role of an Heir of Rage in a typical Sburb session is a passive one; increase enemies' rage (or decrease it, when necessary), decrease allies' rage (or increase it, when necessary), and generally do their best to benefit the team.

Prior to God-tiering, the Heir of Rage would be a very grumpy person. They might lose their temper over trivial things, or constantly be forced into unpleasant circumstances no matter how much they dislike it. They would also be a fairly random person, being unpredictable in all but their bad mood. 

Ascension is almost always difficult, but the Heir of Rage wouldn't need to worry about it too much - or even think about it at all. As Rage is the aspect of limited choices and Heirs are so closely tied to their aspect, the Heir of Rage would likely have no say at all in whether or not they went God-tier. Either their session would require it, in which case they would be unceremoniously dumped onto their Quest Bed, or the session would deem ascension unnecessary, in which case they'd never get to see their Quest Bed. Inheriting Rage is hard. It's hard and no one understands.

Once the Heir of Rage reached Godhood they would probably become even more irritable. But, due to the recently gained control over their aspect that came with the power boost, they may seem more calm, focused, and intense, with a lower probability of the Heir complaining or being outwardly cross.

The inversion of an Heir of Rage would be a Mage of Hope; one who actively spreads knowledge of positive emotion, harmony, and faith.

The potential land of an Heir of Rage might be LOOAF, or the Land of Onslaught and Fury. The bull-like consorts of this land are constantly looking for a fight, and involved in a planet-wide, eternal death-match with each and every other consort. Though the consorts are ferocious, they are also wary enough to know not to pick a fight with anyone stronger than them. Only by embracing their inner rage can the Heir hope to walk the long road to their denizen unchallenged.

Heirs tend to go for convenience over practicality when equipping their strife deck, and little is known about the chosen weapons of Rage players. While just about anything might work, a class this dangerous might not need a strife specibus at all!

Their greatest strength is their unabashed fury, while their greatest weakness would come from misunderstanding themselves or their role.

Their special power would be turning into pure anger. No idea what that would look like, but it'd sure be hard to fight. An upset Heir of Rage would be a dangerous opponent indeed!
