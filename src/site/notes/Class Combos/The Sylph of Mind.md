Sylphs are the passive half of the Creation class, with their counterparts being the more active Maids. Sylphs heal, repair, and replenish their aspect, or physically heal teammates using their aspect as a power source. They are often the ‘moms’ of the team - nosily involving themselves in everything and giving unrequested advice. The Sylph must learn when their help is wanted though; forcing their help will only exacerbate teammates’ problems, no matter what the Sylph’s intentions were. Though may get on a few nerves, Sylphs do genuinely mean well and care deeply for their teammates. Expect them to be analytical and more than a little self-righteous. Some motormouth tendencies would not be a surprise.

Mind is the aspect of intelligence, awareness, and decision making. It’s counterpart is Heart. Mind players tend to be subtle, cunning, and manipulative, though it should be said that that is not necessarily a bad thing.

The Sylph of Mind would have the power to heal intelligence and decision making. If an option is lost to the team, the Sylph can restore its availability. Or, if a teammate is injured, they can heal them through intellect and focus - brain injuries being especially within their jurisdiction. The Sylph of Mind would be an excellent addition to any team - just ask Mituna.

The role of a Sylph of Mind in a typical Sburb session is a passive one: healing the physical injuries of teammates, guiding teammates through indecision or mental breakdowns, and fighting the Derse royalty.  Beware though - while Sylphs may seem to be the very definition of a passive class, their melee fighting ability is shockingly potent and they can wreak a lot of havoc.

Prior to God-tiering, the Sylph of Mind would be a know-it-all who constantly got into others’ business - which isn’t necessarily a bad thing, though their allies may not appreciate it. They’re usually right (and they usually know it) and it simply wouldn’t do to let their dear friends go mucking things up without their guidance, now would they? The Sylph really does have everyone’s best interests at heart, though they may come off as just a little bit smug about it.

Ascension would be fairly simple for a Sylph of Mind. They would likely see it as nothing more than the most logical decision - moreso if the team had reached some kind of impasse that required great strength. The only thing standing between them and immortality is good old-fashioned human fear, but that could definitely be enough to hold even the most logical player back.

Post god-tiering, the Sylph of Mind would be able to divert armies by repairing what they had perceived as impossible options. Even a null session could gain a new option for success if the Sylph is strong enough.

The inversion of a Sylph of Mind is a Prince of Heart; one who actively destroys individuality, soul, and emotion.

The potential land of a Sylph of Mind might be LOGAN, or the Land of Glyphs and Neurons. Connecting neurons light the sky of this ruin-covered planet, but what they make visible is not a pleasant sight. The lammergeier consorts have been enslaved by the denizen, and they are doomed to live their lives in subjugated ignorance. It’s up to the Sylph of Mind to repair their knowledge and intellect, and to remind them that more choices exist than the one of servitude they have been allowed. Plus, if the Sylph has the time and feels up to it, the glyphs within the ruins lead to quests and treasure when translated.

Sylphs tend to have transformative strife specibi, such as Aranea’s fluorite octet, or Kanaya’s chainsaw/lipstick. Little is known about the weapons of Mind players, as only one has been seen. Almost anything can be used in this case, as long as it can transform.

The greatest strengths are their intellect and healing, but their greatest weakness is their tendency to become involved in others’ affairs without invitation.

The special ability of the Sylph of Mind is Ultimate Therapy! Nobody can heal your traumatized brain like a mind-based healer. What’s that? You don’t think you’re traumatized? Of course you are! It’s Sburb! Everyone’s traumatized here!
