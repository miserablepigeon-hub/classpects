Heirs are the passive half of the Manipulation classes, with their counterpart being Witches. They passively change, move around, or alter their aspect, and over time begin to completely embody it. Heirs tend to have very strong friendships, but don’t always act when they should.

Mind is the aspect of intelligence, awareness, and decision-making. It’s counterpart is Heart. Mind players tend to be subtle, cunning, and manipulative, though it should be said that that is not necessarily a bad thing.

The Heir of Mind would have the ability to passively manipulate intelligence and decisions. In moments of high danger or intensity the Heir of Mind may literally become their aspect. This is a mysterious ability specific to Heirs, but they don't seem to be entirely in control of such displays.

The role of an Heir of Mind in a typical Sburb session would be a passive one: decrease enemy intelligence and choices, increase allies' intelligence and choices, and generally try to benefit their team.

Prior to God-tiering, the Heir of Mind would be snarky, self-righteous, and irritatingly clever. With the ability to alter others' decision making on a subconscious level, the Heir might be a little over-confident in their skills and be used to having things go their way.

Ascension would be pretty likely for an Heir of Mind. They would likely not be bogged down by the emotional aspect of facing death, and with their predisposition toward careful decision making they would probably have a very good reason for their ultimate choice.

Post God-tiering, The Heir of Mind would be a powerful force of choice and awareness, gently guiding their team toward the right decisions. They should probably stay away from serious battles, but would definitely be able to handle themselves in some minor strifes.

The inversion of an Heir of Mind would be a Mage of Heart; one who actively understands individuality, soul, and emotion.

The potential land of an Heir of Mind might be LOTAM, or the Land of Truth and Memory. The slug consorts of this forest world seem to be constantly hiding things - their names, their goals, where they're from, and where they're headed - and it's up to the Heir of Mind to uncover the facts. Unless, perhaps, the Heir has already uncovered them? As they progress on their journey, they will remember more and more about their planet, until they have fully inherited their memories. Only then can they face their denizen.

Heirs seem to use blunt, powerful weapons, while Mind players use weapons that can be deployed tactically. Hammerkind, fistkind, batkind, or clubkind could all work for a strife specibus.

Their greatest strength is their wit and raw intelligence, but their greatest weakness stems from excess passivity or a misunderstanding of their own role.

The special ability of an Heir of Mind is becoming the very concept of awareness! Perhaps by reaching a zen-like mental state they can access the entirety of their brain at once in a single hyper-aware moment! Or perhaps they merely make sure everybody is aware of their presence. It's hard to say.
