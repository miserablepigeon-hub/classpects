A Knight of Life strikes me as a very stressed person- they probably have a lot on their plate!

A Life player is a person who deals with Life itself, and that comes with healing, and ensuring the safety of others. A Witch of Life like Feferi is able to heal characters fully, as seen with her healing of WV and a Thief of Life such as Meenah is able to heal via stealing the virility from others, as seen in [S]88k in HSBC. All together, a Life-bound player is a healer that you'd want on your team.

A Knight, on the other hand, is a fighter who has to protect an Apsect that is missing in their session. Dave Strider, a Knight of Time, is fighting for an Aspect so lost on his session, that the B1 session of sburb was practically a speedrun, and Karkat was a Knight of Blood in a session where everyone was one bad word away from a murderfest, so a Knight of Life would be stuck in a session where no one had life.

My guess as to what that entail is this; they would be in a session where life was very scarce. Maybe a doom-bound player is messing up the session, or maybe the denizen of their Land is very ruthless and killing all of their consorts?

An important thing to remember with Classpects is that they are one of the most important parts of a character- Vriska didn't start stealing luck once she joined the sgrub session, after all! A Classpect is a prevailing part of their lives, and it's with them 'till they die.
