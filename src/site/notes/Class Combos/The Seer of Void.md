Seers are the passive half of the Understanding class, with their counterpart being Mages. Seers tend to be a bit self-righteous, with a strong sense of fairness and justice. They fully understand their aspect and share that knowledge with their teammates in order to give the group an advantage. They are among the most passive and strategic of classes.

Void is the aspect of secrecy, mystery, depth, obfuscation, misfortune, and ignorance. Fittingly, little is known about the common traits of Void players, however they consistently find themselves smack in the center of a web of mystery. They are often well known for their romantic lives and connections to partners, as well as for their formidable skill with machinery and electronics. They have luck bordering on the abysmal, but may have the knowledge to maneuver around it with relative ease.

The Seer of Void would have the ability to fully perceive and understand their aspect in the form of secrets and obfuscation. No secret would be safe from the Seer of Void, which ironically would make them quite similar to the Seer of Light - one who sees all information. Their knowledge of what their teammates don't know would make them a valuable asset to say the least.

The role of a Seer of Void in a typical Sburb session is passive, but still very busy: as the strategists who direct the other players toward the best - if most mysterious - outcome, they must map out battle tactics, issue orders, and constantly be on the lookout for any new variables that may throw a wrench in their plans, all while staying out of trouble themselves. While they may be powerful strategists they are pretty crummy fighters, and are better left leaving the dirty work to the other players. 

Prior to God-tiering, the Seer of Void would be a deeply insightful person with few if any people who truly understand them. They would likely have one person who is very dear to them; while this may be either platonic or romantic the feelings would be intense, and probably mutual. They may grow bitter about the fact that nobody seems to notice or understand them, but they might just as easily brush it off.

Ascension would not be entirely necessary for a Seer of Void, given that they are a background player who would be unlikely to get into a lot of fights. Should they decide upon Godhood wholeheartedly though, they would easily learn the location of their quest bed and the mechanics of the process.

Post God-tiering, the Seer of Void would be a fountain of information about literally anything unknown to their teammates. The inner workings of the Void and the Furthest Ring would be imprinted into their mind just as deeply as breathing and blinking. Figuring out the mechanics of the game and its players would be mere child's play.

The inversion of a Seer of Void is a Witch of Light: one who actively manipulates information, relevance, and luck.

The potential land of a Seer of Void might be LOMAS, or the Land of Mirrors and Silence. This dark planet barely reflects the light of Skaia at all, and what consorts there are try their best to stay out of sight. The Seer of Void must rely purely on their visions of secrecy and obfuscation to traverse the mirror maze and reach their denizen.

Seers tend to have fairly innocuous items for their strife decks, while Void players are marked by their use of their hands and little else. Fistkind would be the best fit. Many everyday things could be applied to the Seer of Void's strife specibus, but don't expect it to be used often.

Their greatest strength is their understanding of that which by definition cannot be understood, but their greatest weakness is their low attack power.

The special ability of a Seer of Void would be Perfect Night Vision! Nothing would be able to hide from someone who can see in complete darkness. Hide-and-seek would be a cakewalk, and slumber parties would double in fun. Even moving through the Furthest Ring might become easier - probably not though.
