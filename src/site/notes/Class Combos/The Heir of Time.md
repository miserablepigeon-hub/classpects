Heirs are the passive half of the Manipulation classes, with their counterpart being Witches. They passively change, move around, or alter their aspect, and over time begin to completely embody it. Heirs tend to have very strong friendships, but don’t always act when they should.

Time is the aspect of death, decay, and entropy. It is one of the two cardinal aspects - its partner being Space - which are necessary for any chance of a successful session. Time players tend to be seemingly easy-going, but still waters run deep and they usually have some pretty destructive tendencies to get over.

An Heir of Time passively manipulates decay, death, and entropy. Because of Heirs ability to physically become their aspect, this could become potentially problematic, but if the Heir is well developed it shouldn’t be too much of a problem.

The role an Heir of Time would have in a session would be a passive one, mostly centered on bettering themselves to the best of their ability so that they can better aid their teammates in battle. 

Prior to Ascension, the Heir of Time would be a cool, desirable, but unfortunately unstable individual with an interest in death and history and perhaps a bit more clumsiness than is good for them. Or good for anyone around them. They just knockin shit over all the time it’s ridiculous.

Ascension would be incredibly likely for this class. Embodying death makes a sacrificial slab seem a lot less scary than it would seem to others.

Post-God-Tier, the Heir of Time would be an incredibly powerful player and fighter - but they need to get their emotional problems under control if they really want to excel. A fully realized Heir of Time could decimate armies in moments, but it’d take a lot of work to get them to that point.

The inversion of an Heir of Time would be a Mage of Space, one who actively understands creation, distance, and physical matter.

The potential land of an Heir of Time might be LoBAB, or the Land of Beats and Bayous. This marshy planet is home to crocodile consorts who communicate exclusively through beat-boxing. How do they do it? Do crocodiles have lips? Who knows. The world wasn’t so watery long ago - back when it was first created (though, logically, it was created the instant the player entered the medium, but let’s ignore that for now) the water level was lower and the entrance to the Denizen’s lair was easy to spot. The Heir of Time must comprehend the history of LoBAB and manipulate time in order to get to their denizen and it their questions.

The strife specibus of an Heir of Time could really be almost anything: Heirs tend to have blunt weapons if they have any at all, but Time players have very little consistency in their strife specibi. 

Their greatest strength would be their power and their grasp on the flow of the timeline, but their greatest weakness would be their emotional issues and tendency to repress said issues.

The special ability of an Heir of Time would be controlled aging! As someone who passively embodies time, they would be able to completely control how time affected them - allowing them to turn themselves into an adult right away or even regress back to a more childish appearance. Pretty useful in a game that focuses so heavily on self expression!
