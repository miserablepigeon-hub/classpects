Mages are the active half of the Understanding class, with their counterparts being the more passive Seers. Mages have a powerful and innate knowledge of their aspect, but the way they interact with it gets a bit tricky. Mages are spared the negative effects of their aspect, but their use of the aspect to help teammates is often self-detrimental.

Hope is the aspect of faith, motivation, goals, positive emotion, willpower, unlimited choices, and belief. It’s counterpart is Rage. Ironically, Hope has strong associations with science in spite of being the aspect of faith. Though Hope is arguably the most powerful aspect it is notoriously difficult to use to its full potential. Hope players are often obnoxiously chipper, and entirely set in their beliefs with no chance of being swayed. An important milestone in a Hope player’s growth is falling into despair. Despair is something every Hope player must face, and it’s the player’s decision to rise above it (or not) that defines them and makes them powerful.

The Mage of Hope would completely understand harmony, faith, and willpower and would use this understanding to further their own goals. While they would likely use their skills to help teammates, they would do so in a manner more similar to directing than teaching - telling their allies what to do rather than why they should do it. Due to their role as a Mage, they would be spared from the negative effects of their aspect which would mean that falling into despair would either not happen at all or that they would bounce back quickly. However, they might be especially likely to have faith in an idea or person that proves unreliable.

The role of a Mage of Hope in a typical Sburb session is an active one, though not quite as active as some other classes; pointing allies toward hopeful outcomes, fighting imps, and eventually fighting the Derse royalty.

Prior to God-tiering, the Mage of Hope would be a cheerful, optimistic person of great intelligence, though perhaps not in the traditional sense. They would love learning the inner workings of things, with a special interest in things that motivate or uplift people. They would be liked amongst their peers, but perhaps seen as a bit stiff. The Mage of Hope would be a good person to go to for advice as they could use their knowledge and understanding to point people in the right direction - however they might accidentally worsen a situation if someone needed comfort rather than guidance.

Ascension would be a refreshingly easy affair for the Mage of Hope. So long as they actually wanted to ascend, their knowledge of the things they hope for would lead them straight to their quest bed - as well as giving them the information they need.

Post God-tiering, the Mage of Hope would be a walking library on the subject of faith and willpower. Their knowledge about the goals of opponents would give their allies a tactical advantage - not to mention the Mage's fighting power.

The inversion of a Mage of Hope is an Heir of Rage; one who passively manipulates negative emotions, anger, and limited choices.

The potential land of a Mage of Hope might be LOHAP, or the Land of Heights and Pinnacles. This elegant planet is covered in towering cathedrals, and the tops of the spires contain treasure, scrolls, keys, and all kinds of useful items. Unfortunately, the staircases leading to the tops are loaded with booby-trapped puzzles. The Mage of Hope must use their knowledge of their aspect to solve these puzzles - or they can lead the coral cornsnake consorts to do it for them.

Very little is known about the strife specibi of Mages, but all Hope players use a gun of some kind. Riflekind, pistolkind, BBgunkind, airsoftkind, and harpoongunkind could all work

Their greatest strength would be their knowledge and willpower, but their greatest weakness would be losing so much due to their class.

The special ability of a Mage of Hope would be motivational speeches! A thorough understanding of what keeps people going means that the Mage of Hope is the best suited to spreading it by word of mouth.
