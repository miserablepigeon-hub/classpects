## [Role of the Creator - The Sylph]


Those born with the **Role of the Sylph** are meddlesome by nature. They enjoy being aware of what’s going on with those around them, and can come off as bothersome when they start prying where they shouldn’t. With rich internal lives, they are passionate about their interests and will gladly share and overshare with those they trust, yet may appear to alienate themselves from the rest. An open book for the ones they love, an inscrutable riddle to the rest of the world. Sylphs tend to act for the benefit of what they think is important, be it other people, their beliefs or convictions, even when their help may not be wanted, even if their means are questionable. At their best, they are patient and gentle, bringers of unity and care to their circles. At their worst, they can be Machiavellian, invasive and petty.  
  
Sylphs are heavily tied to their **Aspect**, even more so than other Classes. For them, their Aspect make up an integral part of their lives, and shape them to a great degree. Whether it be Knowledge, Friendship, Faith, Survival, a Sylph’s affinity may range from the Characteristic, to the borderline Obsessive. They’re most comfortable when allowed to engage in their interests, and given enough relevance and importance, they may become one of the most powerful forces you could hope to have on your side. A restrained Sylph will, however, often find themselves held back from becoming relevant, fading into obscurity as they wait for their time to shine, and perhaps, eventually breaking through what binds them to assert themselves where they rightfully belong.  
  
Being one of the Creator Classes, Sylphs are the Passive counterpart to [[Class Combos/The Maid\|The Maid]], and similar to them, their strengths lie in **Making** things. Creating, Increasing, Expanding or otherwise Improving their Aspect, or through their Aspect, their power sets are strongly suited towards Healing, Repairing, Empowering and Enabling their group to continue fighting. Don’t let that make you think they are only suited for the back lines, however, if made to take direct action, a Sylph channelling their Aspect is a force to be reckoned with. They will fight for their cause and for those they love, they will keep going until victory is achieved, or until they drop dead.!
