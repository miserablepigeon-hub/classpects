Pages are the passive half of the Exploitation class, with their counterparts being the more active Knights. Pages tend to be extremely weak throughout the majority of the game, but upon reaching godhood and a state of emotional maturity their power becomes essentially unmatchable by any class (though Lords may possibly be more powerful, it would certainly be a close fight). Pages tend to be easily led around by others and rarely make decisions entirely of their own accord. Pages should avoid Sylphs at all costs, as the Sylph’s tendency to mother and care for others will lead them to try to ‘fix’ the Page - something that throws off the Page’s naturally slow growth and is potentially quite harmful.

Heart is the aspect of Love, Passion, Individuality, and Soul. It’s counterpart is Mind. Heart players may be passionate and illogical, embracing an idea with little to no logical evidence. They are most likely cheerful and very friendly. Unfortunately, Heart players are doomed to have at least one completely disastrous relationship (or an unrequited love), and tend to have splintered personalities that show themselves through roleplay, mood swings, or copies of themselves.

The Page of Heart would have the ability to passively exploit passion and individuality. Though they themselves may not end up doing much, they will arm their allies with the courage to be true to themselves, making this session a good one to find love. This Title in particular would be well-matched with a Knight, to help the latter get over their false front.

The role of a Page of Heart in a typical Sburb session would be a passive one: allowing their soul to work as their weapon, arming allies with individuality, and working to become as strong as possible.

Prior to God-tiering, the Page of Heart would be a friendly, caring, ditz with a love of shipping (Honestly, though? What Heart player doesn’t like a bit of shipping?). They might come across as a bit foolish as times, but their main priority would be their friends and making sure everyone feels comfortable. They would be well-liked, but not well-respected. There’s a pretty high chance of the Page of Heart being taken advantage of, but it’s unlikely that they’ll hold a deep grudge.

Page’s by and large avoid ascending, but if they felt that they had no choice or that it would benefit their team they would be able to muster up the courage to go through with it.

Post God-tiering, the Page of Heart would be unstoppably passionate and completely unique. Assuming that they were well-developed, their indescribable power could mean the difference between life and death for their teammates.

The inversion of a Page of Heart is a Thief of Mind: one who actively steals choices, thought, and intelligence.

The potential land of a Page of Heart might be LODAF, or the Land of Dance and Friendship. The tiled surface of this massive planet is home to some of the greatest social dance parties in paradox space. Unfortunately, the Komodo Dragon consorts are so worried about missing a step and making a fool of themselves that they forget have fun - and that social dance parties involve being sociable. The Page of Heart must arm them with passion and teach them to love themselves, even if they make mistakes. Once the party is truly underway peace will return to LODAF and the Page can start searching for their denizen.

Pages tend to use conventional weapons, while Heart players prefer handheld slicing weapons. Swordkind, knifekind, spearkind, or halberdkind could all work for this class.

The greatest strengths of a Page of Heart are the ultimate power they have available to them and their devotion to their friends, but their greatest weakness is their slow growth rate.

The special ability of a Page of Heart would be being a Top-Tier Wingman! Their ability to arm their allies with romance means that nobody in the Page’s team will ever have to worry about being single! Unless they want to be single, of course.
