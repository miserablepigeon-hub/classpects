Maids are the active half of the Creation classes, with their counterpart being the more passive Sylphs. They create, spread, and shamelessly promote their aspect, but do so more easily if they do it for themselves. It’s almost as if they were ‘maid’ of their aspect. (Get it? ‘Cause ‘maid’ sounds like ‘made’? Haha. Ha.~) They are often mistaken for a passive class due to the fact that their efforts often go unnoticed or overlooked. A well-developed Maid must learn to accept this lack of acknowledgment.

Doom is the aspect of death, sacrifice, rules, order, and authority. It’s counterpart is Life. Doom players tend to lose the most of all the aspects - due to the power of their sacrifices - and have a love of order. An interest in computer coding, following the instructions for Lego sets, or paint by number art books would be right up a Doom player’s alley. Though Doom seems like a gloomy aspect, it’s quite possible to be a peppy, cheerful Doom player.

The Maid of Doom would have the ability to create Doom in the form of rules, order, and sacrifice. Their tendency to go unnoticed might exacerbate their borderline martyr complex, so it would be wise to pair this player off with someone in a makeshift buddy system. This way, the Maid will have someone to drag them back down to reality when they start thinking about sacrificing themselves over trivial matters.

The role of a Maid of Doom in a typical Sburb session is an active one: creating order, killing imps, and taking out the Derse royalty,

Prior to God-tiering, the Maid of Doom would be a kind, orderly person. They would likely lead a simple, straightforward lifestyle and enjoy every bit of it - which might make the transition to Sburb life in the Medium difficult for them. Beneath the surface, though, their simple life is fraught with death and disaster - whether the Maid of Doom knows it or not.

Ascension would be extremely easy for the Maid of Doom, bordering on boring. Sacrifice and death are so intrinsic to a Maid of Doom's existence that they may not even realize that reaching Godhood is meant to be a challenge. However, an underdeveloped or inverted Maid may reject the concept as a whole, which would postpone (but probably not completely halt) their path to ascension.

Post God-tiering, the Maid of Doom would incredibly powerful and helpful player. Assuming that they are at least partially realized, they may be irritated by other players inverting, as this means that they are going against their given roles and causing disorder. This Title borders on being overpowered, and a well-timed sacrifice on their part could completely and permanently alter the rules of the game.

The inversion of a Maid of Doom is a Bard of Life; one who passively destroys energy, rebellion, and healing.

The potential land of a Maid of Doom might be LODAJ, or the Land of Decrees and Judgement. The densely-packed city that comprises the surface of this planet is populated by the bumblebee consorts that busily go about their business. However, they are horrendously inefficient, and no bee is working at something they're actually skilled at. The Maid of Doom must bring order to the city and bring meaning to the bees' hard work.

Maids' strife specibi are usually unconventional weapons based on their ideal career paths. Doom players seem to draw attack power from within themselves, rather than from a weapon. Maybe the Maid of Doom's ideal career involves not holding anything?

Their greatest strength would be the power of their sacrifices, but their greatest weakness would come from over-embracing their sacrificial abilities and failing to live up to their full potential as a result.

The special ability of a Maid of Doom would be Sacrificing Death! Rather than merely giving their life for their cause, the Maid of Doom can sacrifice their death, thus achieving true immortality! Unfortunately, it's unlikely that they will be able to maintain their form on the physical plane, so this is a technique that should only be used as a last resort.
