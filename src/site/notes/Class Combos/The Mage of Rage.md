Mages are the active half of the Understanding class, with their counterparts being the more passive Seers. Mages have a powerful and innate knowledge of their aspect, but the way they interact with it gets a bit tricky. Mages are spared the negative effects of their aspect, but their use of the aspect to help teammates is often self-detrimental.

Rage is the aspect of negative emotions, unpredictability, limited choices, and conviction. Its counterpart is Hope. Rage has associations with religion, which is odd in that the aspect of faith, Hope, is its opposite. In spite of its reputation as ‘bad’ or ‘evil’, Rage is just as necessary as any other aspect and just as likely to be good.

The Mage of Rage would have the power to understand Rage in the form of conviction and limited choices. They could make a good counselor due to their knowledge of negative emotion, and might find themselves defusing tense situations between teammates. It would be difficult to surprise a Mage of Rage because of how thoroughly they understand unpredictability, and they are the person to consult if you feel completely stuck - they could point you toward the few choices you have.

The role of a Mage of Rage in a typical Sburb session is an active one, but more team oriented than the more extremely active classes; enraging or calming enemies, fighting the Derse royalty, and keeping their allies calm and on track.

Prior to God-tiering, the Mage of Rage would probably be a very calm, analytical person. While 'grumpy' may or may not be their default state, they are unlikely to fly into fits of anger, and it's unlikely that others get mad at them often, if at all. When they get their heart set on something they will go to the ends of the earth to get it, but that's all right - their intense conviction doesn't often lead them astray.

Ascension is almost always difficult, but for the Mage of Rage it may be easy. Mages aren't negatively affected by their aspect, so the Mage of Rage wouldn't be forced into or kept from Godhood by limited choices, nor would negative emotions - fear, especially - keep them from ascending. Their conviction would allow them to accept death without too much of a fuss, and no surprises would suddenly appear to deter them. As long as the Mage of Rage actually wanted to reach Godhood, it would be very straightforward.

Post God-tiering, their knowledge of rage would increase along with their power. All Mages lose parts of themselves due to their class, so if it's possible to put it off, now's the time to do it. Loss can't be prevented entirely, but they will gain more as they lose less, so God-tier is really the way to go.

The inversion of a Mage of Rage is an Heir of Hope; one who passively manipulates positive emotion, harmony, and faith.

The possible land of a Mage of Rage might be LOCAL, or the Land of Chaos and Literature. The charred-paper landscape is coupled with blood red skies and angry words flying in swarms. The terrified silverfish consorts scurry for cover beneath the biggest parchment sheets they can find, but that's often not enough. The Mage of Rage must use their knowledge to uncover the story the land is telling and understand the words' anger. Only then can they safely navigate the land to face their denizen.

Nothing is known about the strife specibi of Mages, but Rage players tend to favor religious paraphernalia, or items related to personal interests. Nativitykind, fncysntakind, clubkind, crosskind, or buddhastatuekind might work, among others.

Their greatest strength is their intellect and knowledge, but their greatest weakness comes from losing so much of themselves due to their class.

The special ability of a Mage of Rage is accurately predicting random things. About to face a jump scare? Mage of Rage is prepared. Llama on stilts about to pass by? Mage of Rage saw it coming. R U soooo random XD RAWR roflcopter? The Mage or Rage knows everything that you will say or do before you say or do it.
