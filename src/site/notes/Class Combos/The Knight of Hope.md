Knights are the active half of the Exploitation class, with their counterpart being the passive Pages. They turn their aspect into a weapon or tool in order to accomplish their goals. Knights tend to have low self-esteem, and all Knights have a false personality that they present to the world. Though they have tremendous attack power, any session with a Knight in it is tragically lacking in that Knight’s element.

motion, willpower, unlimited choices, and belief. Its counterpart is Rage. Ironically, Hope has strong associations with science in spite of being the aspect of faith. Though Hope is arguably the most powerful aspect it is notoriously difficult to use to its full potential. Hope players are often obnoxiously chipper, and entirely set in their beliefs with no chance of being swayed. An important milestone in a Hope player’s growth is falling into despair. Despair is something every Hope player must face, and it’s the player’s decision to rise above it (or not) that defines them and makes them powerful

The Knight of Hope would have the ability to weaponize Hope in the form of motivation and faith for their own benefit and the benefit of their team. They can give their enemies false hope, motivate their team, or increase potential choices to lead to ideal outcomes. While the Knight of Hope has incredible skill and attack power, their presence in the session means that their teammates will suffer from a lack of motivation, harmony, faith, and positive emotion

The role of a Knight of Hope in a typical Sburb session is an active one; taking out imps, helping the Space player to breed the Genesis Frog, and fighting the Derse royalty

Prior to ascension, a Knight of Hope might be an outwardly cynical, badass, unfettered loner, but in reality they would be one of the peppiest people to ever resist the urge to take up cheerleading. Should no one else object or be nominated, it would not be unlikely for a Knight to be made a de facto leader of their group of friends, though such a role would be unlikely to be maintained after the game started. In-game, they would be more likely to receive orders than to issue them, because of their status as an active class with powerful fighting skills

Ascension is almost always difficult, but it would be a fairly straightforward affair for the Knight of Hope. Their role as a front line fighter means they would want - if not desperately need - the power boost, and they're willpower and positivity would make it relatively easy to accept death

Post God-tiering, the Knight of Hope would be a terrifyingly powerful opponent. With all the power of the (arguable) strongest aspect at their disposal, the Derse royalty won't know what hit them, and the Genesis Frog will be bred in no time.

The inversion of a Knight of Hope would a Rogue of Rage; one who passively redistributes negative emotions, anger, and limited choices

The potential land of a Knight of Hope would be LOCAS, or the Land of Catapults and Spires. Atop the different spires across this shrine-covered planet are keys to chests and doors. But, the only way to reach the tops of the spires is by launching oneself (or one's turtle consorts) to the top with the various catapults that litter the surface of the land - and the catapults don't shoot straight. The Knight of Hope must utilize their faith and willpower to uncover the correct catapult, placement, and tension for each spire and uncover the keys and secrets of their planet. This catapult practice will come in handy too - should they fight their denizen instead of speaking with them, the catapults could make for handy weapons

Knights tend to use what they perceive as classic or cliched weapons for their strife deck, but all Hope players use a gun of some kind. Maybe two separate weapons? Alchemizing them together could be a solution as well, though. Maybe a Final Fantasy style Gunblade would do the trick

Their greatest strength is their attack power, versatility, and optimism, but their greatest weakness is their low self esteem and inability to accept themselves

The special power of a Knight of Hope is the power of revolution! Weaponizing hope for a better future would surely lead to a successful rebellion. Look out, maniacal dictators of the world!
