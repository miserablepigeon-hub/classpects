Mages are the active half of the Understanding class, with their counterparts being the more passive Seers. Mages have a powerful and innate knowledge of their aspect, but the way they interact with it gets a bit tricky. Mages are spared the negative effects of their aspect, but their use of the aspect to help teammates is often self-detrimental.

Space is the aspect of creation, distance, physical matter, and existence. Space is one of the two cardinal aspects - its partner being Time - which are necessary for any chance of a successful session. Space players are often sweet-tempered and physically separated from their teammates prior to (and sometimes even after) entering the Medium. They dream of taking on a new appearance or form, and luckily for them such wishes are almost always granted - though whether they still enjoy their new form after their transformation is another matter entirely.

The Mage of Space would have the ability to understand physical matter and creation. Their understanding of location would prevent them from getting lost - ever - and finding anything they needed would be a cakewalk. This includes, but is not limited to, Quest Beds, denizens' lairs, and frog temples. Though their attack power is not especially potent, the Mage of Space would be unlikely to get caught in a fight unprepared due to the fact that they would know their enemies' locations.

The role of a Mage of Space in a typical Sburb session is an active one, and the same role shared by all Space players; lighting the Forge and breeding the Genesis Frog

Prior to God-tiering they would likely be a well-rounded scholar. Expect them to be very knowledgable in artistic techniques, or a self-taught master of arts and crafts. They would have a good sense of weight, distance, and size, as well as the physical properties of different materials. Their favourite subjects would be chemistry and physics, though they'd likely enjoy geography as well

Ascension is almost always difficult, and that holds true for the Mage of Space. They could do their job just fine without becoming a God, so they might opt out of Ascension due to fear or an inability to accept their own death. Should they decide to go through with it though, their understanding of distance and matter would allow them to find their Quest Bed in a few moments, easily.

Post God-tiering, their knowledge of Space would increase along with their power. Any information about physical existence that had previously been hidden from them would be uncovered. All Mages lose parts of themselves due to their class, so if it’s possible to put it off, now’s the time to do it. Loss can’t be prevented entirely, but post-ascension they will gain more as they lose less, so God-tier is really the way to go.

The inversion of a Mage of Space is an Heir of Time: one who passively manipulates or becomes decay, inevitability, and destiny.

The land of a Mage of Space is LO(x)AF, or the Land of (x) and Frogs. The second word of a Space player's land is inevitably 'Frogs,' while the first word ('x') is something completely unique to the individual. 

Nearly nothing is known about the strife decks of Mages, but Space players tend to use large, powerful items that cannot be mistaken for anything but a weapon. Riflekind, chainsawkind, pistolkind, axekind, or flamethrowerkind might be suitable.

Their greatest strength is their intellect and knowledge, but their greatest weakness comes from losing so much of themselves due to their class.

The special power of a Mage of Space is Hyper Tracking. Intense knowledge of locations and physical matter means the Mage of Space could find anything, or anyone that they needed to. You can run, but you can't hide!
