Rogues are the passive half of the Allocation classes, with their counterparts being the more active Thieves. They are generally easygoing, friendly, well-liked, and well-known for their relationships - failed or otherwise. Rogues possess the ability to steal their aspect, but rather than keeping it for themselves they redistribute it to where it is either most needed or most lacking. They have been called the Robin Hood of classes.

Void is the aspect of secrecy, mystery, depth, obfuscation, misfortune, and ignorance. Fittingly, little is known about the common traits of Void players, however they consistently find themselves smack in the center of a web of mystery. They are often well known for their romantic lives and connections to partners, as well as for their formidable skill with machinery and electronics. They have luck bordering on the abysmal, but may have the knowledge to maneuver around it with relative ease.

The Rogue of Void would have the ability to take and redistribute mystery and misinformation. Whether they’re spreading misinformation and gossip or straight up using the abyss to send care packages, the Rogue of Void would be able to make sure everybody is on the same page of having no clue what’s going on. It’s Sburb. What’d you expect, easy answers? They also have the ability to steal the absence from something, causing something that didn’t exist to suddenly do so. 

The role of a Rogue of Void in a typical Sburb session is a passive support role, maintaining social harmony and redistributing resources. Their passive redistribution Void role means that they are uniquely suited to finding out the secrets of their allies and enemies alike, which they must use to maintain cohesive group relations and tear their enemies to fucking shreds. They’re also particularly well suited to weapon acquisition and item distribution.

Prior to God-tiering the Rogue of Void would be a seemingly air-headed but very friendly person at the center of a fairly large social circle. They’d have a tendency to know things they shouldn’t which might make friends think they might be a lot more intelligent than they let on... right up until they receive the next typo-laden text recounting the Rogue’s misadventures, and they change their minds again. That’s not to say that they are unintelligent, but they do have a tendency to come across that way to folks who don’t know them very well. 

Ascension isn’t really a necessity for this title, and the Rogue of Void might have a fairly difficult time making that happen if they don’t feel it’s absolutely necessary. On the other hand, if they feel that they do need to in order to support their friends they won’t have a problem with it at all.

Post Ascension, the Rogue of Void would be a downright unreadable player and a major aide in the fight against the Derse royalty. Their ability to redistribute irrelevance means they could effectively disguise their teammates by shrouding them in void. By making the royals think their attackers are unimportant and beneath their notice even as they’re being attacked, the players would gain a major advantage.

The inversion of a Rogue of Void is a Knight of Light, one who actively exploits information, relevance, and luck.

The potential land of a Rogue of Void might be LOBAN, or the Land of Blanks and Networks. This planet is stacked high with communication terminals, manned by the turtle consorts. They’re supposed to send each other important information in morse code, but all of the spaces are in the wrong spots, changing the intended meaning drastically. Once the Rogue of Void fully realizes their potential, they will inherently understand the places where the spaces should go and redistribute them accordingly. At that point the turtles can translate the messages and the Rogue can use that information to find their denizen. 

For their strife specibus Rogues tend to use long, thin, two-handed weapons, while void players are generally known for using no weapon, or their fists. If the weapon in question were invisible or seemed to disappear at times that could also work with the theme. 

Their greatest strength would be their easy-going demeanor and adaptability, but their weakness would be their seeming air-headedness and somewhat limited fighting capacity.

The special ability of the Rogue of Void would be stealing the Void from an object that doesn’t exist to bring it into reality. Because of their passive class though, they’re better at this when the object in question is going to someone else who needs it.
