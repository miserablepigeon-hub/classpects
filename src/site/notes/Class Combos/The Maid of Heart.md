Maids are the active half of the Creation classes, with their counterpart being the more passive Sylphs. They create, spread, and shamelessly promote their aspect, but do so more easily if they do it for themselves. It's almost as if they were 'maid' of their aspect. (Get it? 'Cause 'maid' sounds like 'made'? heheheheheeeeeehhhhhhhh. Follow for more needlessly explained puns.) They are often mistaken for a passive class due to the fact that their efforts often go unnoticed or overlooked. A well-developed Maid must learn to accept this lack of acknowledgment.

Heart is the aspect of Love, Passion, Individuality, and Soul. Its counterpart is Mind. Heart players may be passionate and illogical, embracing an idea with little to no logical evidence. They are most likely cheerful and very friendly. Unfortunately, Heart players are doomed to have at least one completely disastrous relationship (or an unrequited love), and tend to have splintered personalities that show themselves through roleplay, mood swings, or copies of themselves.

A Maid of Heart would be able to create passion and individuality wherever they went. Pretending to be someone you're not could be seen almost as a personal insult to a Maid of Heart, who would try their 'heart'est (heheheh. Like 'hardest'... Okay, I'll stop.) to make you comfortable in your own skin. While a Maid of Heart would probably not be a very powerful fighter, they would still be a very useful ally. Their ability to bring people together in a way that makes them all comfortable would help to prevent fall-outs between players; something that could mean the difference between life and death in a game like Sburb

The role of a Maid of Heart in a session is an active one, though it may not seem that way. They must actively create individuality by cleaning up the emotional mistakes other players get themselves into - spreading Heart, helping their teammates, and creating more passion for themselves. It is a difficult role, but it's one they must accept - even if they're doing it from the sidelines.

Prior to God-tiering, a Maid of Heart would probably be an extreme shipper. Having an innate knowledge of their aspect would allow them to see exactly who would benefit from what relationships. While their tendency to try and play matchmaker may irritate some, they would almost certainly be well-liked amongst the other players due to their cheerful disposition and helpful nature. Some workaholic tendencies would not be a surprise.

Ascension for a Maid of Heart would be difficult. While it is possible for them to reach Godhood, it is unlikely that they would rush off to their Quest Bed to kill themselves. They would probably prefer to be killed by someone else, or even to be moved onto their Quest Bed while dying. However, if they felt that they needed to reach Godhood - for the sake their friends or to become more powerful - it would be difficult to stop them.

Post God-tiering, they would probably spend a lot more time alone. They would start to work a bit less for the sake of the group and more toward their own interests. However, given how friendly and well-intentioned they are, this would not be a sign of rebellion but of focus and determination.

The inverse of a Maid of Heart is a Bard of Mind; one who passively allows the destruction of choices and intelligence.

The potential land of a Maid of Heart might be LOSAC, or the Land of Statues and Consciousness. Consorts no longer live on this planet, because the denizen has transformed them into the hundreds of marble statues that cover LOSAC's garden-like surface. The Maid of Heart must awaken the individual soul of each statue, at which point it will come back to life and join her.

Maid's rarely seem to use their Strife Specibi, and the weapons they have are often unconventional. Handheld slicing weapons seem to be popular amongst Heart players, though, so a Maid of Heart may want to equip their strife deck with something like Knifekind, clawkind, swordkind, or razorkind. 

A Maid of Heart's greatest strength would be their individuality and passion, but their weakness would be an inability to accept no one noticing their efforts.
Their unique power would be making clones of themselves. Turning their splintered personality into entirely new individuals would be right up the Maid of Heart's alley.
