Knights are the active half of the Exploitation class, with their counterpart being the passive Pages. They turn their aspect into a weapon or tool in order to accomplish their goals. Knights tend to have low self-esteem, and all Knights have a false personality that they present to the world. Though they have tremendous attack power, any session with a Knight in it is tragically lacking in that Knight’s element.

Rage is the aspect of negative emotions, unpredictability, limited choices, and conviction. Its counterpart is Hope. Rage has associations with religion, which is odd in that the aspect of faith, Hope, is its opposite. In spite of its reputation as ‘bad’ or ‘evil’, Rage is just as necessary as any other aspect and just as likely to be good.

The Knight of Rage would have the ability to weaponize negative emotion and unpredictability for their own advantage and the advantage of their teammates. They can utilize the conviction of enemies and allies alike in order to achieve their goals. Though their attack power is formidable, their presence means that their session will have a lack of Rage. While this may sound like a good thing, an overabundance of possibilities and a lack of conviction or determination are decidedly problematic

The role of a Knight of Rage in a typical Sburb session is an active one; taking out imps, helping the Space player to breed the Genesis Frog, and fighting the Derse royalty

Prior to God-tiering, the Knight of Rage might be the very definition of a Stepford Smiler. Their teammates might be surprised that someone who's so seemingly sweet-tempered and cheerful could be a Rage-player. There's nothing wrong with the Knight's grumpy, irritable interior, so they (and others) must learn to accept their true nature. Should no one else object or be nominated, it would not be unlikely for a Knight to be made a de facto leader of their group of friends, though such a role would be unlikely to be maintained after the game started. In-game, they would be more likely to receive orders than to issue them, because of their status as an active class with powerful fighting skills

Ascension would be reasonably straightforward for a Knight of Rage, but it would have a possibility of failing due to fear. Their role as a front-line fighter means that they would need and want the power boost and lower mortality rate associated with godhood, but negative emotion might keep them from accepting death. Limited choice might just as easily force them to ascend, though

It should be noted that - though the process of reaching Godhood for the Knight of Rage personally is about average - the odds of their teammates ascending is greatly limited due to them having a large number of possibilities and limited conviction to help them through the one that involves dying

Post God-tiering, the Knight of Rage would be an extremely powerful ally. With all the negative emotion of every living thing in the medium at their disposal (and in a game like Sburb, there's a lot of misery to go around), the Derse royalty won’t know what hit them, and the Genesis Frog will be bred in no time

Expect a well-developed Knight of Rage to be similar to a Berserker; utilizing a state of total, complete anger to boost their attack power and absolutely decimate opponents

The inversion of a Knight of Rage is a Rogue of Hope; one who passively redistributes positive emotion, harmony, and faith

The potential land of a Knight of Rage might be LOMAA, or the Land of Moats and Anger. The irate toad-like consorts of this marshy planet will pick a fight with anything they see - unless they're too busy preparing to fight something else. The Knight of Rage must use the consorts' fury to solve puzzles, fight imps, and traverse the swampy landscape. It'd be tricky, but amassing a consort army might help the Knight to fight their denizen, if that's what they choose.

Knights tend to use what they perceive as classic or cliched weapons for their strife deck, while Rage players prefer religious paraphernalia. Plain old swordkind, lancekind, axekind, or riflekind might work, but some kind of mystical holy weapon would be best. 

Their greatest strength is their attack power, versatility, and determination, but their greatest weakness is their low self esteem and inability to accept themselves.

The special power of a Knight of Rage is the Ultimate Jump-scare Technique. Surprise friends and foes alike with this new and interesting way to make people wet themselves from fear!
