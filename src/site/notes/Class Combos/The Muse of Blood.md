Muses are the passive half of the two Master classes, with their counterparts being the more active Lords. Muses possess the combined abilities of all of the passive basic classes (Seer, Heir, Rogue, Page, Sylph, and Bard). They are the most passive of all classes, and little is known about them. Though they are extremely powerful, they rarely - if ever - cause change through direct action, but rather through their presence.

Blood is the aspect of unity, family, bonds, friendship, and responsibility. Its counterpart is Breath. Blood players tend to be overly serious - often to a laughable point. Blood players may also have unique physical blood - such as a mutation, rare blood type, or disease - or a unique bloodline/ family tree.

The Muse of Blood would completely embody unity and friendship, though they may not seem to do much. Muses' power stems from their presence rather than their actions, so expect a Muse of Blood to effortlessly hold their team together and promote long lasting bonds, but to not do a lot of fighting or leading.

No session with a Muse or Lord could be called typical, but the role of a Muse of Blood in an Sburb session is a passive one; invite or promote unity, responsibility, and friendship.

Prior to God-tiering, the Muse of Blood would be an extremely caring, people-oriented person. Due to outside interference, they probably would have been kept from doing anything of importance, but they skills they do have are likely well-developed. They most likely have a bit of trouble figuring out when people are joking, especially at someone else's expense.

Ascension is almost always difficult. For the Muse of Blood, however, it is both difficult and easy. They are unlikely to ascend for their own sakes, but for their friends (or even for strangers!) they would have no problems facing death.

Post God-tiering, the Muse of Blood would become even more powerful, and even more passive. Should they put their mind to it, they might end up filling the entire universe with unity and friendship, creating a complete absence of strife.

The inversion of a Muse of Blood is a Lord of Breath; one who controls freedom, change, and wind.

There is not enough information about either of the Master Classes to theorize on their potential lands. Just know that their quest would be extreme.

It would not be surprising to find that a Muse had no strife specibus at all - if they did they almost certainly would not end up using it. They really don't need one, but should they choose to have one, they might follow the tendency of Blood players to equip their strife deck with a weapon pertaining to their future career goal.

Their greatest strength is their incredible power, but their greatest weakness is their remarkable passivity.
The special ability of a Muse of Blood is embodying unity, family, bonds, friendship, and responsibility. Why yes, that is the same as their regular ability. The Muse of Blood is already special.
