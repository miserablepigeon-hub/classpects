Pages are the passive half of the Exploitation class, with their counterparts being the more active Knights. Pages tend to be extremely weak throughout the majority of the game, but upon reaching godhood and a state of emotional maturity their power becomes essentially unmatchable by any class (though Lords may possibly be more powerful, it would certainly be a close fight). Pages tend to be easily led around by others and rarely make decisions entirely of their own accord. Pages should avoid Sylphs at all costs, as the Sylph's tendency to mother and care for others will lead them to try to 'fix' the Page - something that throws off the Page's naturally slow growth and is potentially quite harmful.

Mind is the aspect of intelligence, awareness, and decision-making. It’s counterpart is Heart. Mind players tend to be subtle, cunning, and manipulative, though it should be said that that is not necessarily a bad thing.

The Page of Mind would have the ability to allow their teammates to weaponize choices and decision-making. They would essentially be a team armory of intelligence; equipping allies with the awareness and choices to take on enemies.

The role of a Page of Mind in a typical Sburb session would be a passive one; equipping allies with thought and choices, focusing on their personal planet quest, and working to become more powerful. 

Prior to God-tiering, the Page of Mind might be quiet and more than a little nerdy. Much like the stereotypical geek, they are probably very intelligent, easily bullied, and unwilling or unable to stand up for themselves. They probably have a few very close friends who adore them, but they may not be fully understood or appreciated. Being a Page is hard. It's hard and nobody understands. Luckily, the Page's intelligence would keep them out of the way of a lot of trouble, and they'd be a great help to their friends.

Ascension is almost always difficult, and that definitely holds true for the Page of Mind. Unfortunately, difficult though it may be, it's very important that a they achieve Godhood. It would be vital for bringing out their high power levels or, barring that, keeping them alive until they're strong enough to defend themselves.

Post God-tiering, the Page of Mind would be a force to behold. With their emotional problems and trauma resolved they would not only be a one-person army capable of taking out the Derse royalty with a single thought, but they would also be able to provide their allies with Mind in such abundance that they could practically turn the entire game into a curb-stomp victory.

The inversion of a Page of Mind is a Thief of Heart; one who actively steals individuality, soul, and emotion.

The potential land of a Page of Mind might be LOSAP, or the Land of Scrolls and Pondering. The fox consorts have no homes, and live between the bookshelves of the massive outdoor library covering the entire surface of this planet - but the true tragedy is that none of them can read! The Page of Mind must arm them with that knowledge, teaching them by extension how to build homes and tools, how to grow food on the shelf-covered ground, and stories of their history. Out of gratefulness, the foxes will take their new skill and scour the planet for knowledge of how the Page might overcome their obstacles, find their quest bed, fight the Derse royalty, and meet their denizen.

Pages, like Maids, tend to use items themed around their ideal career. Whipkind, spoonkind, knifekind, lancekind, or pencilkind could all work, but personalized ones are best.

The greatest strength of a Page of Mind is also their greatest weakness; their unbelievably slow, but incredibly strong growth.

The special ability of a Page of Mind is Hyper Meditation! While meditation can have some wonderful effects on physical and mental health, the Page could meditate to such a degree that they unlock their mind's true potential and begin to alter reality through psychic waves!
