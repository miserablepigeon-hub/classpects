Time: The aspect of rhythm and destruction. Time is connected to death, the past and future, taking action, small details, the destination over the journey.

Time is repetition, iteration, cycles, pace, patterns, preservation, decay, continuity, and management. Time is the steady tick of a clock, the constant rotation of an ever-turning gear.

Narrative connection: Pacing.
Times opposing aspect is Space.

[Time is one of the fundamental fabrics making up paradox space and is therefore an aspect required to win Sburb. If your session does not have a Time player, your session is doomed to fail.]

Those bound to the aspect of Time are fighters, full stop. Their lives are often marked by struggle, not so much because fate has it in for them, but because they are fundamentally incapable of just accepting things as they come. They value action over passive acceptance, even if that may not be the wisest or safest choice. Don't try to tell a Time-bound to sit still and look pretty. They are very goal-focused, and tend to value the destination over the journey, and you won't find them making that journey in any traditional sort of way. To quote cheesy posters found on many a guidance counselor's wall-"impossible is just a word". If you need a miracle, they are who you call. At their best, the Time-bound are empathetic and relentless problem-solvers. At their worst they are ruthless, defensive, and impulsive.

so far im just seeing TIME as things happen or are being done, things are happening, will be happening, have happened. things are being done, will be done, have already been done.

REMEMBER, OTHER CONNOTATIONS AROUND TIME AND SPACE CAN BE USED TO TITLE SOMEONE AS A TIME AND SPACE. YOU DONT NEED TO FIT EVERY OR MOST IDEAS RELATING TO A CLASS, YOU JUST NEED ONE STRONG CONNECTION OR MANY SMALLER CONNECTIONS

actions or events in the present, future or past.

past: stuck on the things already having happened and not moving from it or staying in it to enjoy it endlessly

present: to have the thing you want to happen always happen now or always pushing for it to happen

future: to prepare the now for the future endlessly and set up without needing the pay off

these all can be combined in many ways to make an ever bigger scale picture of TIME be it better or worse

to enjoy the past ideas, constantly pushing and repeating them in the present, setting up endlessly hoping something will work out or to see a bigger picture of it all, giving a when to things and push when it is time to push and prepare when it is time to look into the past and enjoy or reflect when you have time to, instead of being stuck in one mode or view of it, or instead of switching endlessly without looking at the whole chain of time at once. to see the past present future events all at once and act in a way that works with all of them ideally.

to REFLECT and REPEAT in the past, in events remembered or in action

to PUSH and PERSEVERE in the present, in events seen or in action

to PREPARE and DIRECT in the future, in events predicted/ imagined or in action

__________________________________________
**The Sylph of Time** would be that who Makes Time for Others. This could be seen as them being keepers of the Timeline, ensuring their friends have enough time to fulfill their Quests and reach their Goals. It may also relate to literally freezing things in Time to give an edge on how much Time they have left. Healing through Time could be akin to allowing them to increase or improve the natural healing of their body, making fresh wounds scar instantly, or letting regeneration kick in more quickly. As the Aspect representing strife and destruction, however, they may also incite fighting and challenge- Healing through strife could be seen as trying to toughen people up for what’s to come.
__________________________________________
**The Maid of Time** would have a similar set of abilities. As the Active Counterpart, however, they would primarily Make Time for Themselves. While still able to perform actions for others, their focus would be internal, self-improvement through time and perhaps training, fated recovery and even rebirth. Making Time and Improving Time for themselves could be a similar skill to the Sylph’s supposed Time Freeze, but more oriented to protecting themselves and giving them the Time they need to escape or do what they want. They’ve got all the Time in the world to do what they need- They’re Made of It after all
___________________________________________
**The Knight of Time** would be that who Serves Time to Others. Also as one to Serve through Time- Using Time Loops to give a short Session enough time to be fruitful or going back in Time to aid those around them, as we see in the comic. They’re also ones to spend their Time serving others, and those who Fight for the cause they deem just, and will use Time in whatever way is needed to reach their goal.
___________________________________________
**The Page of Time** on the other hand, would be one to Serve Themselves Time. Someone who makes others stick up for them when they can’t, and that are offered other people’s Time to make up for their own lack, someone who Serves Themselves Time and waits, for things to get better or for things to happen in due Time. And when the Time is right, they may rise and exert a powerful control over Time itself. Serving others Time could also be parsed as ageing enemies through attacks
___________________________________________
**The Seer of Time** would be one who Knows Time for Others. A clear map of the Timeline, perception of the Past and Future… However, other Seers can have similar abilities of clairvoyance. What makes them special is the way their Aspect narrows down the paths they can see. As such, with Time being the most broad Aspect regarding the paths the future holds, it’s likely they would be able to see everything branching out in front of them, unsure of what path is going to be taken, or what path would be the best, and having to learn to parse through the mess of interwoven Timelines. They may also be able to tell when an Battle is incoming and prepare for it, and just the same, they may be to see everything as if Time moved in slow motion, letting them get ready to counter any incoming attack.
___________________________________________
**The Mage of Time** on the other hand, would Know Time for Themselves. While Seers and Mages may have very similar powersets, Mages seem to rely more on instinct or a sixth sense than what they can see in detail in their mind’s eye. An uncanny knowledge of the Timeline, being able to sense the way things are going to go down, urging them to keep them the same or change them as needed. Perhaps, even knowing ahead of time how your next move is going to go down during a Strife, preparing for the best moment to strike, avoiding conflict that would only end badly for themselves
___________________________________________
**The Heir of Time** would be one who Changes Time for Others. Inevitability is a troubling concept in many ways, the idea that things are fated to happen. As such there’s no one better suited to deny inevitability than a Heir of Time, with enough knowledge of what’s going to happen next, it’s their job to manipulate the Timeline to head down one path or another. They may also be more likely Change events that are going to happen through Time Loops and Time Travel. And just like that, they too may alter the flux of Time in battle. However the Heir of Time should be careful, lest they be consumed by the Timeline, left Doomed, consumed by constant Strife, or losing themselves to the amount of time they spend fixing things up.
___________________________________________
**The Witch of Time** on the other hand, would be one who Changes Time for Themselves. They’re manipulators of Time as well, speeding up and slowing time are practically a given, and when it comes down to it, what happens in the Timeline may be left entirely up to them. They may as well be Changed by Time, changed by a life of Strife and fight against the forces of inevitability, for better or worse
___________________________________________
**The Rogue of Time** would be one to Steal Time for Others. Taking up the time of those they’re opposed against to give more Time to their allies could be seen as them acting like a nuisance, bothering and Strifing constantly as a distraction of sorts. Stealing Time, they may also be able to negate some part of the events that happened in the Timeline, and of course, using Time Travel to easily scavenge and take that which is no longer there would make them quite efficient thieves.
___________________________________________
**The Thief of Time** would be one to Steal Time for Themselves. Scavengers, waiting for the moment they can spring to action and take what they want, or even hopping into a Strife at the best moment to steal the credit. They should be careful not to take much of their allies’ Time, and much like the Rogue, their control over Time may allow them to negate things or the flow of Time itself around them, perhaps making their own little distorted Bubble of Time flowing differently.
___________________________________________
**The Bard of Time** would be one who Destroys Time for Others. They could nullify the effects of ageing by destroying their flow of time, or on the other hand, they may Destroy through Time and speed up the process of ageing and decay dramatically. They may be ones to break through the Time Loops for some reason, splintering the Timeline, or at the very least incite the limits of the Timeline to be tested, and maybe, with luck, break the game enough with Time Shenanigans that they don’t have to follow the Alpha anymore.
___________________________________________
**The Prince of Time** would be one why Destroys Time for Themselves. With the meaning of Strife and the few possible uses Destroying the Timeline may have, the Prince is more likely to use Time to Destroy- Time Clones and loops carefully crafted to ensure the destruction of their enemy, shattering a Span of Time as if it hadn’t occurred to avoid its effects, Stopping Time by ‘destroying’ or reducing its flow, the Prince of Time would be a powerful ally for sure.
___________________________________________

**The Muse of Time** may be one who Commands Time for Others. They may fight against the forces of inevitability, struggling to keep the Timeline together and lead it away from strife and decay. Even in a Doomed Timeline, their will alone may allow it to Persist for long enough to either try and fix it, or merely escape outside before inevitability consumes all. And just the same, they may completely halt or speed up the flow of Time, allowing them to act and aid where they may be needed, regardless of time constraints.
___________________________________________
**The Lord of Time** would be one who Commands Time for Themselves. A possible source of conflict, they may live for the thrill of the battle, and exploit Time to their advantage with Time Clones. Their most powerful weapon however, would be Inevitability, as the Timeline bends to their will and Time Loops. With fate on their side, however, they should never lie complacently and let things run their course, lest those they’re opposed to find a way to break beyond fate itself, or worse, disregard the Time Loops and cast everyone, including the Lord, into a doomed Timeline.
