Space: The aspect of creation and beginnings. Space is new things, focused on the wait-and-see, the big picture, the here-and-now, the journey over the destination. Space is destiny, matter, physics, making, innovation, and intuition. Space is a vast endless infinity of possibility.

Narrative connection: Setting.
Spaces opposing aspect is Time.

[Space is one of the fundamental fabrics making up paradox space and is therefore an aspect required to win Sburb. If your session does not have a Space player, your session is doomed to fail.]

Those bound to the aspect of Space are, as the name suggests, concerned with the big picture. They are patient, masters of the art of 'wait-and-see', and are inclined to take things as they come. That isn't to say that they're pushovers or willing to let injustice lie-they just choose their battles wisely, understanding that sometimes you have to let something burn to the ground in order to build it back better and stronger than before. To this effect, they tend to be innovators, concerned with creation and redemption. Catch them recycling the old to make the new, the fresh, and the beautiful. For the Space-bound, the journey is as, if not more, important than the destination; how they do something is as important as what they do. At their best, they are steady, impartial, and creative. At their worst, they can be detached, apathetic, and vague.

when thinking of space all i think about are just stars and the connections between those heavenly bodies in the sky, making stories or ideas with them

some painter making strokes, chipping away or constructing a skeleton to make the details perfect, and have the picture be as imagined or planned tiny little dots making something large the how and how long though don’t seem to be a factor in this thing making connections and stories between the stars and stories doesn’t give much direct influence the stroked, chips, construction doesn’t give me an idea on how long or how much effort it takes to make the thing making the details perfect or as the artist imagined or planned it to be doesn’t give the scope of how much is needed for this perfect product.

to CONNECT CONCEPTS 
to DILIGENTLY CONSTRUCT the work
to PERFECT CREATIONS

our concepts we connect may not be as good as we thought they were to work at the piece but we don't have an eternity to make the perfect creation in the persons head, but it isnt necessarily the best way to go to be creative connecting concepts far and wide to be patient and be able to work with someone/ something regardless how long to go for the highest quality that can be made

to be fair its way easier to understand them if i just see really ass or really good examples of either aspect
__________________________________________

**The Sylph of Space** would be that who Makes Space for Others. Space is the Aspect of Creation, which puts the Sylph as the Creator of Creation- Able to physically shape the setting around them for the benefit of others could be quite the strong Skill. In a more metaphorical sense, they are pacifiers and auspistices, separating people, putting Space between them for their benefit, and of course, able to ‘Create Space’ within people, they could be seen as people able to tear others in half. Healing Space, on the other hand, could be seen as mending tears in the fabric of reality.
__________________________________________
**The Maid of Space** would have a similar set of powers, but aimed for Themselves. Along with the already inherent implication of laying back and isolationism given by the Aspect, Maids of Space may be ones to push things holding them back away, creating Space between them. Shaping reality for themselves and however they see is most beneficial to their well being. Creating and Improving Space could, additionally, be seen as allowing the creation of Pocket Dimensions and Hammerspace Enclosures, letting them put away and retrieve things from spaces that seem too reduced. Of course, someone Made of Space could act as a Portal or gateway to other places themselves, or even come to Embody the Universe in the same way Sn**o**wman did
__________________________________________
**The Knight of Space** would be one to Serve Space to Others. Teleporting is a given, or a Portal ability of some kind, through which they can easily warp anywhere they may be needed to Serve, like a sort of Omnipresent being. Using Space to Serve others is a powerful skill, able to make use of everything Physical, of Dimensions, everything from growing bigger to using practically everything effectively as a weapon. And in turn, Serving their Space to others may parse as giving their place to others, switching positions whenever needed, as well as Serving Space between them, isolating themselves for other people’s good.
__________________________________________
**The Page of Space** however, would be that who’s Served Space. With its connotations of isolationism, someone being Served Space by others can be parsed as being left alone, and isolating themselves to not have to deal with problems sounds interesting. Being Served through Space, could also parse as being remotely aided by others, or perhaps even being served because of their Size- Whether it’s someone Big that makes others consider them to have stronger potential than they have, or so Small they make others want to protect them. And in due time, even alone, they will show the world the power of the Universe, their mastery of everything physical around them, and perhaps, even of their own physical form.
__________________________________________
**The Seer of Space** would be one to Know Space for Others. Where the Seer of Time seems more focused on the broad development of the Timeline, the Seer of Space would be more linked to Omnipresence. Able to see, at any given moment, everything that’s happening in their general location, picking and choosing what places or people to survey, and preventing nasty surprises or unexpected developments. They may also be able to see how specific objects or material locations may fare in the future or in the past, tracing the timeline of something specific. And of course, with its ties to Creativity, Drawing and the Setting, they may do prophetic drawings or sense how the setting is going to change, giving them a chance to prepare for any upcoming problems.
__________________________________________
**The Mage of Space**, however, would Know Space for Themselves. An understanding of the Physical World, they’d be accurate and never miss when they put their mind on it. Science or Art may come naturally to them, and without even having been there before, they may already know a place like the back of their hand, allowing them to easily find hidden rooms or spot ambushers before they jump on them.
__________________________________________
**The Heir of Space** is one who Changes Space for Others. The manipulation of Space is a seriously powerful ability, but it’s also not the only thing the Heir would be able to do. For one, the may also Change themselves, dissolving into particles or even changing the composition or shape of themselves. They may alter the battlefield entirely and help the Session move on to other places when all seems lost. Changer of Creation and Changer through Creation, they could just as easily invent or make the tool that’d mark the difference between victory and defeat. But the power of Space is immense and lonely- The Heir should be careful not to be consumed by this power, lest they are left behind, and alone.
__________________________________________
**The Witch of Space** would be one who Changes Space for Themselves. More likely to directly manipulate Space, we see this power manifest in canon as having a complete control over the Dimensions of items and the Momentum they hold, but other properties may as well be subject to this. Terraforming and modifying the landscape of their Session as they may see fit, creation beckons them, but much like the Heir, claiming immense power always comes with a risk.
__________________________________________
**The Rogue of Space** would be one who Steals Space for Others. This makes them sound like kleptomaniacal hoarders, that will take anything physical they may need useful for the future. And in the same way, they may be able to take away proportions or certain characteristics from one thing and give them to another, shifting sizes around or infusing certain materials in some way. The use of Space to Steal could also imply portals or teleportation, and Stealing Creativity could imply a tendency of taking ideas from other people.
__________________________________________
**The Thief of Space** would be one who Steals Space for Themselves. Anything that isn’t bolted to the ground belongs to them, and just you wait until they get a saw and rip even that for themselves. They’re not ashamed of stealing virtually anything in order to further their goals. And when it comes down to it, it’s not just physical objects they may take for themselves- Taking upon the characteristics of objects around them or forming armor of some sort from materials around them, they’re not beyond changing their bodies with what they take to end up on top
__________________________________________
**The Bard of Space** would be one to Destroy Space for Others. Destroying through Space may mean their ability to reach out with drawings or art of some sort to destroy a physical location, prophetic pieces of destruction, or perhaps a good old fashioned destruction of anything physical in their way. One could also think they could Destroy the isolationist connotations of Space, bringing their Group together- Or allowing Destruction through their own Isolation, not intervening in a fight and simply letting things go awry.
__________________________________________
**The Prince of Space** would be one to Destroy Space for Themselves. The connotations of this Classpect could be that they’re able to rend and crush anything they set their sights on, whether it be simply shattering or disintegrating it. Destroying through Space also could imply a degree of Teleportation to use for combat, much like Bec Noir does. And in turn, Destroying Creativity, they may also come across as logical and cold, or with a disregard of imagination.
__________________________________________
**The Muse of Space** would be one who Commands Space for Others. An inspiration of creativity, they may infuse others with the desire to create, and just the same, they may influence that which is around them through their own creativity, through their own art. While at risk of being isolated from the rest, they may wield the immense power of Space itself, and take hold of the Setting, deciding to bring forth something new for everyone, or tear away what’s already existing.
__________________________________________
**The Lord of Space** would be one who Commands Space for Themselves. With an iron grip on everything that exists physically, and the power to decide whether it exists or not anymore, they shape reality as they see fit as a creator God of sorts. The Universe is their sandbox, to the point even that which they draw may become a reality. And with such immense power over that which exists, they may as well be able to directly interact with every part of said Universe, an Omnipresent entity, that can be anywhere and everywhere all at once.
