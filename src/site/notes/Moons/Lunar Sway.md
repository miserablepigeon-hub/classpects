The Lunar Sways

titles are just simple descriptions of a character or person and don’t describe their entire selfand in the most literal sense use only 2 to 3 words to describe something, class of aspect. when figuring out a title, describe a person or character simply, use only one or two sentences and from that you can develop a title. it does take some practice, but beyond that it is a simple process in a simple and intuitive system.

for story writers or character makers or classpectors, treat the title as a simple description of the character that more can be done with later. god of chaos and disorder, defender of the family, one who fights with the book, an old skilled scholar of the weird and unkown, a handyman that doesn anything to serve their boss, these are a few of the many possible titles that can be turned into a classpect (or atleast one part of the aspect or class). now with the basics out of the way lets continue to defining everything  

REMEMBER, OTHER CONNOTATIONS AROUND PROSPIT AND DERSE CAN BE USED TO TITLE SOMEONE AS A PROSPIT AND DERSE. YOU DONT NEED TO FIT EVERY OR MOST IDEAS RELATING TO A CLASS, YOU JUST NEED ONE STRONG CONNECTION OR MANY SMALLER CONNECTIONS

The extended zodiac is right about the aspects and lunar sway but there is more to their description (notice how light doesn’t mention luck yet when Andrew hussie describes vriska or james roach they describe light with luck for them)

The two dream moons of the sburb players, each player seems to have one though we know of a player who had 2 (sollux, the gemini, duality troll)  and seemingly one who had none until the story later revealed it not to be the case (aradia, the aries dead troll).

characters have been assigned to each moon though on what metric is a bit nebulous, at the very least none of the players seemed openly dissatisfied with the dream moon they are placed in. I personally dont have much of an opinion i hold on to with prospit and derse, though i pick whatever definition works the well when describing a character or person, especially since no single definition given describes it perfectly for all characters, it’s a hyper flexible system after all. so ill give you ALL the options i have for PROSPIT & DERSE

PROSPIT & DERSE

From what some fans have gathered, PROSPIT & DERSE is

- Good and Evil in the sense that prospitians can seek to do good or well, to go with their ideal. While dersites can avoid the bad or do things despite being bad
- Trusting and Skeptical asda
- Expressive and Shielded sadas
- Genuine and Guarded asdasd

From the extended zodiac

- Creative and Analytical sa
- Trusting and Skeptical sda
